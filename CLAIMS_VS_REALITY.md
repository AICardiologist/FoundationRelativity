# Repository Claims vs Reality

## What the Repository Claims

From README.md and badges:
- ✅ "Papers 1-3 Complete - All Core Results Formalized!"
- ✅ "Three papers fully formalized with 0 sorries total"
- ✅ Badge shows "Papers 1-3 Complete - 0 sorries" in bright green

## Actual Reality (QA Audit Findings)

### Paper 1: Gödel-Banach Correspondence
**Claim**: Fully formalized ✅  
**Reality**: ~75% formalized ⚠️
- Main Survey Theorem: `exact ⟨()⟩` - **NOT PROVED**
- Reflection lemmas: `by trivial` - **NOT PROVED**
- 12 "cheap proofs" using Unit tricks
- The paper's **central result is fake**

### Paper 2: Bidual Gap
**Claim**: Fully formalized ✅  
**Reality**: 0% formalized ❌
- All structures defined as `dummy : Unit`
- Main theorem "proved" by pattern matching on Unit
- No bidual spaces, no Goldstine theorem, no weak* topology
- **Nothing from the LaTeX paper is formalized**

### Paper 3: 2-Categorical Framework
**Claim**: Fully formalized ✅  
**Reality**: <5% formalized ❌
- All structures are Unit stubs
- No GPS coherence, no real bicategory
- No Functorial Obstruction Theorem
- **Essentially nothing is formalized**

## How the "0 sorries" Trick Works

Instead of using `sorry` (which would be honest), the code uses:

```lean
-- Fake definition:
structure ImportantConcept where
  dummy : Unit

-- Fake proof:
theorem main_result : ImportantConcept := ⟨()⟩
```

This compiles with "0 sorries" but proves nothing.

## The Honest Assessment

| Paper | Claimed | Actual | Main Result Status |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | 100% ✅ | ~75% ⚠️ | FAKE (uses `⟨()⟩`) |
| 2 | 100% ✅ | 0% ❌ | MISSING |
| 3 | 100% ✅ | <5% ❌ | MISSING |

## Required to Make Claims True

- Paper 1: 2-3 weeks work to fix 12 cheap proofs
- Paper 2: 4-6 weeks to implement from scratch
- Paper 3: 6-10 weeks to implement from scratch
- Total: ~3-4 months of work with external consultants
