MATHLIB4 SEARCH REPORT: Closed Subspaces of Reflexive Spaces
==============================================================

SEARCH SUMMARY:
Searched the Mathlib4 source code in /Users/quantmann/FoundationRelativity/paper_7_bundle/.lake/packages/mathlib for theorems about reflexive spaces and their subspaces.

KEY FINDINGS:

1. IsReflexive Class Definition
   File: Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dual/Defs.lean (lines 198-306)
   - Class IsReflexive R M is defined as: the natural map to double dual (eval R M) is bijective
   - Notation: [IsReflexive R M]

2. Current Theorems About IsReflexive:
   
   A. WAYS TO CONSTRUCT REFLEXIVE SPACES:
   
   - IsReflexive.of_split (line 265)
     MOST RELEVANT: If N is a retract of a reflexive space M (i.e., there exist 
     linear maps i: N →ₗ M and s: M →ₗ N with s ∘ i = id), then N is reflexive.
     This is essentially a "split exact sequence" theorem.
   
   - IsReflexive.equiv (line 288)
     If M ≃ₗ[R] N (linear equivalence), then N is reflexive if M is.
   
   - IsReflexive.of_finite_of_free (Lemmas.lean line 258)
     If M is [Module.Finite R M] and [Free R M], then IsReflexive R M
   
   - Instance (Lemmas.lean line 265)
     If [Module.Finite R N] and [Projective R N], then IsReflexive R N
     This assumes N is a projective finite module.

   B. WHICH SPACES PRESERVE REFLEXIVITY:
   
   - Dual R M is reflexive (line 260)
   - Product M × N (if either/both are reflexive) (line 270)
   - ULift M (line 282)
   - MulOpposite M (line 298)

3. THEOREMS ABOUT SUBMODULES AND CLOSED SUBSPACES:
   
   File: Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dual/Defs.lean (lines 310-400+)
   
   - mapEvalEquiv (line 274): Order isomorphism between subspaces of M 
     and subspaces of Dual(Dual(M))
   
   - Submodule.dualAnnihilator (line 332): For any submodule W ⊆ M,
     W.dualAnnihilator = {φ ∈ Dual(M) | ∀ w ∈ W, φ w = 0}
   
   - Submodule.dualCoannihilator (line 348): Inverse operation
   
   - Quotient equivalences (Lemmas.lean line 620+):
     * dualQuotEquivDualAnnihilator: Equivalence between Dual(M/W) and W.dualAnnihilator
     * quotDualCoannihilatorToDual: Nondegenerate pairing
   
   File: Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dual/Lemmas.lean (lines 413-430)
   
   - Subspace.dualAnnihilator_dualCoannihilator_eq (line 413):
     For vector spaces over a field: W.dualAnnihilator.dualCoannihilator = W

4. CRITICAL LIMITATION - NO DIRECT THEOREM FOR CLOSED SUBSPACES:
   
   IMPORTANT: There is NO theorem in the searched Mathlib that directly states:
   "A closed subspace of a reflexive space is reflexive"
   
   Why? Because:
   - The reflexivity definition (IsReflexive) is purely algebraic
   - A closed subspace being reflexive requires a topological condition
   - Topological properties aren't automatically inherited algebraically
   
   The closest theorem is IsReflexive.of_split, which requires:
   - N is a direct summand (retract) of a reflexive space M
   - This is STRONGER than just being a closed subspace
   - A direct summand is a special case of closed subspace (with a projection)

5. WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR CLOSED SUBSPACES:
   
   To prove a closed subspace is reflexive, you would typically need:
   
   a) Use IsReflexive.of_split if the closed subspace is complemented
      (i.e., has a continuous projection from the ambient space)
   
   b) Use specific properties:
      - If over a field K and finite-dimensional: FiniteDimensional instance
        makes it reflexive via IsReflexive.of_finite_of_free
      - If the closed subspace is a Banach space with WLPO/LPO properties
      
   c) Manual proof: The quotient M/W is dual to some functional space,
      and if M is reflexive and W is closed, construct the pairing explicitly

6. INSTANCES FOR FINITE-DIMENSIONAL SPACES:
   
   File: Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dual/Lemmas.lean (line 285)
   
   - instFiniteDimensionalOfIsReflexive: If [IsReflexive K V], then [FiniteDimensional K V]
   - Converse exists for fields
   
   This means: Any finite-dimensional vector space over a field is reflexive.

CONCLUSION:
============

NO - Mathlib4 does NOT have a general theorem stating "closed subspaces of reflexive 
spaces are reflexive" as a standalone result.

However, specific theorems available are:
1. IsReflexive.of_split - for COMPLEMENTED subspaces (strong condition)
2. Finite-dimensional vector spaces are reflexive (via instances)
3. Projective finite modules are reflexive

For the P2_BidualGap paper's needs, you would need to either:
- Assume the closed subspace is complemented (stronger)
- Work in finite-dimensional settings (automatic reflexivity)
- Develop a custom proof using the topological structure + reflexivity definition
- Use constructive properties (WLPO, LPO) to build the required bijection explicitly
