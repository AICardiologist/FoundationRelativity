# Agent Coordinator — CRM Series

**Purpose:** Track parallel agent work across git worktrees. Every agent reads this before starting and writes updates after milestones.

**Rules:**
1. Read this file first — check for conflicts with your planned work.
2. Claim your task by adding an entry below before starting.
3. Update your entry after each meaningful milestone.
4. Mark `done` and note the branch/PR when finished.
5. Do not modify other agents' entries.
