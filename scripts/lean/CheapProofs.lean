  CheapProofs.lean
  
  Runs in CI: `lake exe cheap_proofs`
  Flags any declaration that:
    • is a theorem/lemma
    • has no incomplete proofs
    • AND whose reduced proof term mentions only
      Init.*, Std.*, Tactic.*, Classical.*, Logic.*, Unit, True, False, PUnit
      
  This prevents the use of Unit/() tricks to fake "0 incomplete proofs" status.
