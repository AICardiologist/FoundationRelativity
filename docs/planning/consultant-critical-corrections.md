# Critical Corrections from Consultant (Paper 4)

## Summary of Errors We Made

### 1. Misapplied Perturbation Theory ❌
**Our mistake**: Used λ₁(L_N) ≤ λ₁(L₀) + ⟨v₁, ΔL_N v₁⟩/⟨v₁, v₁⟩

**Correct**: Must use full Rayleigh quotient since v₁ is NOT the eigenvector!
- λ₁(L_N) ≤ R(v₁, L_N) = R(v₁, L₀) + ⟨v₁, ΔL_N v₁⟩/⟨v₁, v₁⟩
- R(v₁, L₀) ≠ λ₁(L₀) in general

### 2. Wrong Torus Geometry ❌
**Our mistake**: Counted n neck edges

**Correct**: Torus has 2n neck edges!
- Periodic boundary conditions create TWO boundaries
- One at x = n/2, another at x = 0

### 3. Invalid Negative Weights ❌
**Our mistake**: Subtracted H_N from weights, giving negative values

**Correct**: Use resistance model
- Add H_N to resistance (reciprocal of weight)
- New weight = 1/(1 + H_N), always positive

### 4. Missing Discretization Scaling ❌
**Our mistake**: Fixed n independent of h

**Correct**: Must couple n = C/h
- Ensures discrete model approximates continuum
- Makes threshold scale correctly as O(1/h)

## Corrected Results

### Upper Bound
λ₁(L_N) ≤ 8/[n(1 + H_N)]

### Sharp Threshold  
Gap collapses when H_N > 64/(Ch) - 1

### Sturm Implementation
Must use Bareiss algorithm or Subresultant PRS to control bit complexity

## Key Lessons

1. **Variational bounds require care** - Can't substitute eigenvalues for Rayleigh quotients
2. **Topology matters** - Torus wraps around, doubling boundary edges
3. **Physical constraints** - Weights must stay positive
4. **Scaling is crucial** - Discrete must approximate continuum properly
5. **Algorithmic complexity** - Standard methods can have exponential intermediate values

## Action Items
- [x] Create ConsultantBoundsRevised.lean with corrections
- [ ] Implement Bareiss algorithm for Sturm's theorem
