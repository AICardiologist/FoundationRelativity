# Foundation-Relativity Roadmap v5.0
**Last Updated**: August 19, 2025  
**Current Sprint**: Post-E Planning

## 🎯 Project Overview
A Lean 4 formalization demonstrating how mathematical pathologies behave differently under various foundational assumptions (BISH vs ZFC).

## ✅ Completed Milestones

### Paper 1: Gödel-Banach Correspondence
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (0 sorries)
- **Achievement**: Full formalization of rank-one operators encoding Gödel's incompleteness

### Paper 2: WLPO ↔ BidualGap (Sprint E Complete)
- **Status**: ✅ NEARLY COMPLETE (3 WLPO sorries)
- **Sprint E Achievement** (August 19, 2025):
  - Dual isometry: (c₀ →L[ℝ] ℝ) ≃ₗᵢ ℓ¹
  - 81% sorry reduction (16 → 3)
  - Clean HasWLPO typeclass architecture
  - 0 build errors
- **Previous Achievements**:
  - Sprint D: WLPO ↔ BidualGap bidirectional equivalence
  - Sprint B: Complete quotient framework
  - Sprint A: Gap → WLPO direction

## 🚧 In Progress

### Paper 3: 2-Categorical Framework
- **Current Status**: 6 sorries documented
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Next Steps**: Comprehensive analysis needed

### Paper 4: Spectral Geometry
- **Current Status**: Phase 1B - 85% complete (61 sorries)
- **Focus**: Undecidable eigenvalues via discrete approximation
- **Timeline**: 6-7 weeks to completion

## 📅 Q3 2025 Roadmap

### August 2025 (Remaining)
- [ ] Complete WLPO proof details in Paper 2 (optional)
- [ ] Begin Paper 3 comprehensive analysis
- [ ] Continue Paper 4 Phase 1B implementation

### September 2025
- [ ] Paper 3: Reduce sorries to <3
- [ ] Paper 4: Complete Phase 1B
- [ ] Documentation consolidation

### October 2025
- [ ] Paper 4: Phase 2 - Continuous case
- [ ] Final integration testing
- [ ] Prepare for publication/release

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- **Paper 2**: Maintain 3 WLPO sorries (or complete with proofs)
- **Paper 3**: Reduce to <3 sorries
- **Paper 4**: Complete discrete model (0 sorries)
- **Overall**: Maintain 0 build errors

### Mathematical Goals
- Demonstrate foundation-relativity across all 4 papers
