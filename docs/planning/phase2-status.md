# Phase 2 Status Report

## Current State (After Initial Phase 2 Work)

### Files Created/Modified
1. **SpectralTheory.lean** - Variational characterization framework
2. **PerturbationTheory.lean** - Analysis of TM perturbation effects  
3. **MainTheorem.lean** - Proof of main spectral gap jump theorem

### Sorry Count Evolution
- **Start of Phase 2**: 19 sorries (after Phase 1B)
- **Current**: 32 sorries (added new theoretical infrastructure)
- **Net change**: +13 sorries (expected - we added new theoretical layers)

### Sorry Distribution
- IntervalBookkeeping.lean: 3
- TuringEncoding.lean: 2
- Pi1Encoding.lean: 6
- NeckGraph.lean: 0 (fully proved!)
- **SpectralTheory.lean: 6 (new)**
- **PerturbationTheory.lean: 8 (new)**
- **MainTheorem.lean: 7 (new)**

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Theoretical Framework ✅
- Variational characterization avoiding eigenvalue computation
- Perturbation theory connecting TM steps to spectral changes
- Main theorem structure with forward/reverse directions

### 2. Proof Architecture ✅
- Clear flow from TM → perturbations → spectrum → undecidability
- Identified key technical lemmas
- Documented all dependencies

### 3. Consultant Question ✅
- Focused on core technical gap
- Ready to send when appropriate

## Key Insights Gained

### 1. Perturbation Accumulation
- Halting at step n → perturbation ≤ Hₙ ≈ log(n)
- Non-halting → perturbation = H_N → ∞
- Threshold around h²/8 separates regimes

### 2. Proof Strategy
- Forward: Easy (halting bounds perturbations)
- Reverse: Harder (need contrapositive argument)
- Key lemma: Large gap implies bounded perturbations

### 3. Technical Challenges
- Main gap: Quantitative perturbation bounds
- Need: ∂λ₁/∂ε sensitivity analysis
- Consultant can help here

## Next Steps

### Immediate (While awaiting consultant)
1. **Refine MainTheorem.lean**
   - Complete forward direction proof
   - Sketch reverse direction more carefully
   
2. **Document key bounds**
   - Make harmonic series bounds explicit
   - Clarify sensitivity assumptions

3. **Reduce redundancy**
   - Some lemmas may be duplicated across files
   - Consolidate similar results

### After consultant response
1. **Implement perturbation bounds**
   - Use recommended approach (first-order, Rayleigh, or other)
   - Prove key sensitivity lemmas

2. **Complete main theorem**
   - Fill in technical gaps
   - Verify all logic flows correctly

3. **Connect to undecidability**
   - Import halting problem results
   - Complete the reduction

## Assessment

### What's Working Well
- Clear theoretical structure
- Good separation of concerns
- Main ideas are sound

### What Needs Work
- Quantitative perturbation analysis (awaiting consultant)
- Some proof details still sketchy
- Need to consolidate and reduce sorries

### Realistic Goal
- Reduce to ~15-20 sorries for complete discrete model
- Have main theorem fully connected
- All critical logic paths verified

## Recommendation
Continue refining the main theorem while we wait for consultant input. The theoretical structure is solid - we just need the technical perturbation bounds to complete the proof.
