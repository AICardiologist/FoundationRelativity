# Question for Senior Math AI Consultant

## Context
We've successfully implemented your variational framework for the discrete CPW model. The upper bound via test function and lower bound via Weyl's inequality are set up. We need precise coefficients to complete the quantitative analysis.

## Specific Technical Questions

### 1. Perturbation Coefficient in Variational Bound

For the discrete neck torus with n vertices on each side:
- Unperturbed: neck edges have weight h, spectral gap λ₁ ≈ h²/4
- Perturbed: neck edge k gets weight h - εₖ where εₖ = 1/k
- Test function v₁: +1 on left side, -1 on right side

**Question**: In the variational bound
```
λ₁(L_N) ≤ λ₁(L₀) + ⟨v₁, ΔL_N v₁⟩/⟨v₁, v₁⟩
```

What is the exact coefficient? Our calculation suggests:
- ⟨v₁, ΔL_N v₁⟩ = -4n × H_N (since (v_i - v_j)² = 4 across neck, n neck edges)
- ⟨v₁, v₁⟩ = n² (total vertices)
- So perturbation term = -4H_N/n

**Is this correct? Does the n-dependence matter for the threshold analysis?**

### 2. Weyl's Inequality Sharp Bound

For the lower bound via Weyl's inequality:
```
λ₁(L_N) ≥ λ₁(L₀) + λ_min(ΔL_N)
```

**Question**: What is the sharp bound on λ_min(ΔL_N)?
- Naive bound: λ_min(ΔL_N) ≥ -||ΔL_N|| ≥ -H_N
- Can we do better using the specific structure (perturbations only on neck)?
- Does the sparsity pattern give a tighter bound?

### 3. Critical Threshold for Gap Collapse

Given the bounds above, we need the precise threshold where the gap collapses.

**Question**: For the discrete model with h = 1/2:
- At what value of H_N does λ₁ cross below h²/8?
- Is there a buffer zone where the gap is small but non-zero?
- Should we worry about second-order effects?

### 4. Sturm's Theorem Implementation Details

You mentioned using Sturm's theorem for primitive recursiveness. For our tridiagonal-like discrete Laplacian:

**Question**: 
- Is the characteristic polynomial's degree exactly n²?
- Are there simplifications for the neck structure that make Sturm sequences more efficient?
- Any subtleties in showing the rational arithmetic stays bounded?

### 5. Smooth Case Transition (Looking Ahead)

While focusing on discrete, we want to ensure our approach extends.

**Question**: Does our discrete variational framework directly suggest the IFT approach for smooth? Specifically:
- Should we think of the discrete eigenvector v₁ as approximating the smooth eigenfunction?
- Will the same h²/4 vs h²/8 threshold work in smooth case?
- Any warnings about what breaks in the continuum limit?

## What Would Most Help Us

1. **Exact coefficients** in the variational bound (especially the n-dependence)
2. **Sharp threshold** where H_N causes gap collapse  
3. **Confirmation** that our discrete approach is "morally correct" for the eventual smooth case
