## 🎯 Phased Elimination Strategy

### Phase 1: Mathematical Infrastructure (Auxiliaries.lean)
**Timeline**: Sprint 46-47  
**Target**: 5-7 sorries  
**Priority**: HIGH - Other proofs depend on these

#### Easy Targets (Sprint 46)
| Line | Sorry | Strategy | Effort |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 37 | Standard linear algebra result | Find mathlib lemma | 1 hour |
| 64 | Surjective pullback → isometry | Classical result | 2 hours |
| 72 | Standard Fredholm alternative | Well-known theorem | 2 hours |

#### Medium Targets (Sprint 47)
| Line | Sorry | Strategy | Effort |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 43 | Compactness of P_g | Rank-one → compact | 4 hours |
| 81 | Fredholm not generally compact | Counterexample | 3 hours |

#### Technical Debt (Optional)
| Line | Sorry | Strategy | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| 51, 57 | Subtype issues | Refactor types | Low |

### Phase 2: Core Spectral Theory (Core.lean)
**Timeline**: Sprint 46  
**Target**: 2 sorries  
**Priority**: HIGH - Well-understood results

| Line | Sorry | Mathematical Content | Strategy |
|------|-------|---------------------|----------|
| 515 | spectrum_projection_is_01 | σ(P) = {0,1} for projections | Direct eigenvalue computation |
| 527 | spectrum_one_sub_Pg | σ(I-P) = {0,1} from σ(P) | Spectral mapping theorem |

### Phase 3: Logic-Analysis Bridge (Correspondence.lean)
**Timeline**: Sprint 48  
**Target**: 2-3 sorries  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Connects the two sides

| Line | Sorry | Dependencies | Complexity |
|------|-------|--------------|------------|
| 28 | consistency ↔ c_G | Definition alignment | Medium |
| 41 | Kernel analysis | Needs Phase 1 & 2 | Medium |
| 47 | Fredholm application | Needs Aux line 72 | Easy |

### Phase 4: High-Level Theorems (Statement.lean)
**Timeline**: Sprint 49-51  
**Target**: 4-7 sorries  
**Priority**: VARIES - Some critical, some optional

#### Critical Results (Must Have)
| Line | Sorry | Impact | Prerequisites |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 43 | godel_banach_main | Main theorem | All phases |
| 51 | consistency → surjectivity | Key lemma 1 | Phase 1-3 |
| 57 | surjectivity → consistency | Key lemma 2 | Phase 1-3 |

#### Framework Integration (Should Have)
| Line | Sorry | Purpose | Priority |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| 66 | foundation_relativity | Connect to framework | Medium |
| 71 | pathology_hierarchy | ρ-level connection | Medium |
| 79 | injectivity_characterization | Fredholm property | Medium |

#### Advanced Theory (Could Have)
| Line | Sorry | Content | Academic Value |
|------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 85, 125 | Fredholm applications | Advanced results | Future work |
| 108, 112, 119 | Gödel diagonal lemmas | Logic theory | Future work |
