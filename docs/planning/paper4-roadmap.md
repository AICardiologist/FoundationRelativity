# Paper 4 Roadmap: Spectral Geometry and Undecidable Eigenvalues

## Overview

Paper 4 represents the most ambitious component of the Foundation-Relativity project: formalizing undecidable spectral gaps in Riemannian geometry. This will be the first smooth-geometry realization of spectral independence.

## Mathematical Goals

### Main Theorem
Construct a computable Riemannian metric $g^*$ on the 2-torus such that:
$$\lambda_1(g^*) \leq \gamma^* \Longleftrightarrow \text{Con(PA)}$$

Where:
- $\lambda_1(g^*)$ is the first eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
- $\gamma^*$ is a rational threshold
- Con(PA) is the consistency of Peano Arithmetic

### Key Components
1. **Cheeger Neck Construction**: Cylindrical bottlenecks controlling eigenvalue scale
2. **CPW-Style Encoding**: Curvature bumps encoding Turing machine computations  
3. **Foundation-Relativity**: Degree ρ=2 requiring countable choice
4. **Smooth Geometry**: Complete elimination of piecewise-flat artifacts

### Plan B: Simplified Construction  
If Riemannian geometry proves too complex:
- Use piecewise-linear approximations
- Focus on combinatorial Laplacians
- Reduce to graph-theoretic setting
