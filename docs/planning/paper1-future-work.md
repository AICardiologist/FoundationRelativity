# Paper 1: Future Work for Complete LaTeX Alignment

## Overview

While the Lean formalization successfully captures the core G√∂del-Banach correspondence (Sections 1-4 of the LaTeX paper), several advanced topics from the paper could be formalized for completeness.

## Priority 1: Core Extensions

### 1. Bidual Gap Construction (Section 5)
**LaTeX Content**: Second manifestation of undecidability in non-reflexive spaces

**Required Lean Components**:
- Definition of `c_0` and `‚Ñì^‚àû` spaces
- Banach limit or ultrafilter construction
- Bidual embedding theory
- Proof that operator on `c_0` differs from its bidual extension

**Estimated Effort**: Medium (requires Banach space infrastructure)

### 2. Logical Hierarchy (Section 6.1-6.2)
**LaTeX Content**: Shows construction works with weaker logics

**Required Lean Components**:
- Double-negation shift (DNS) axiomatization
- Construction of `c_G^dns` under DNS
- Proof of `¬¨¬¨Surj ‚Üî ¬¨¬¨G` equivalence

**Estimated Effort**: Low (mostly axiomatization)

## Priority 2: Advanced Generalizations

### 3. Bornological Spaces (Appendix A)
**LaTeX Content**: Extends to most general functional analysis setting

**Required Lean Components**:
- Bornological space definitions
- Generalized Fredholm theory
- Atkinson's theorem in bornological setting

**Estimated Effort**: High (new mathematical framework)

### 4. Stable (‚àû,1)-Categories (Appendix B)
**LaTeX Content**: Shows undecidability in derived categories

**Required Lean Components**:
- Stable ‚àû-category infrastructure
- Derived categories D(R)
- Abstract Fredholm endofunctors
- Localization theory

**Estimated Effort**: Very High (requires HoTT/‚àû-category library)

## Priority 3: Supporting Details

### 5. Concrete Spectrum Calculations
**LaTeX Content**: Explicit resolvent formulas

**Required Lean Components**:
- Resolvent operator (ŒªI - G)^{-1}
- Norm calculations
- Determinant for trace-class perturbations

**Estimated Effort**: Low

### 6. Model-Theoretic Perspective
**LaTeX Content**: Discussion of different PA models

**Required Lean Components**:
- Model theory of arithmetic
- Non-standard models
- Relative consistency results

**Estimated Effort**: Medium

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Logical Extensions (1-2 months)
1. Add DNS axiomatization
2. Implement double-negation version
3. Document logical hierarchy

### Phase 2: Bidual Construction (2-3 months)
1. Develop c_0/‚Ñì^‚àû theory
2. Implement Banach limits
3. Prove bidual gap theorem

### Phase 3: Category-Theoretic Extensions (6+ months)
1. Choose ‚àû-category framework
2. Develop stable category theory
3. Implement abstract construction

## Benefits of Full Implementation

1. **Completeness**: Machine-checked version of entire paper
2. **Generality**: Shows phenomenon beyond Hilbert spaces
3. **Connections**: Links to other areas (topology, algebra)
4. **Foundation**: Infrastructure for Papers 2-4

## Current Status Assessment

The current Lean formalization:
- ‚úÖ Proves the main theorem completely
- ‚úÖ Captures all essential mathematics
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates foundation relativity
- ‚úÖ Achieves 0 sorries

The missing components are:
- üìù Additional examples of the same phenomenon
- üìù Generalizations to broader settings
- üìù Alternative logical frameworks

## Recommendation

The current formalization is **publication-ready** for the core result. The additional components would enhance the work but are not essential for establishing the main G√∂del-Banach correspondence.

Future work should prioritize:
1. The bidual construction (different locus, same phenomenon)
2. The logical hierarchy (shows robustness)
3. Leave ‚àû-categories for dedicated future project
