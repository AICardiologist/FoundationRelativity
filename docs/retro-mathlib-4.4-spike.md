# Mathlib 4.4 Upgrade Spike - Retro

**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Branch**: spike/upgrade-mathlib-4.4 (deleted)  
**Time box**: 30 minutes (exceeded)  

## Summary
Aborted mathlib 4.4 upgrade spike due to excessive build times exceeding the 2-minute threshold.

## What Happened
- Started upgrade by changing lakefile.lean from v4.3.0 to v4.4.0
- Ran `lake update` successfully 
- Build process for mathlib dependencies took significantly longer than expected
- Multiple dependency rebuilds required due to version change
- Build time exceeded the 2-minute abort threshold specified in Math-AI instructions

## Technical Details
- mathlib 4.4.0 requires rebuilding all downstream dependencies
- Lake cache helps but initial builds still take considerable time
- CI infrastructure may handle this better with proper caching

## Recommendation
Consider the mathlib 4.4 upgrade as a separate infrastructure task rather than a quick spike. Options:
1. Schedule dedicated time for the upgrade with proper CI cache warming
2. Continue with current mathlib 4.3.0 and maintain TD-B-001 technical debt
3. Investigate if spectrum lemmas can be backported to 4.3.0

## Action Taken
Per Math-AI instructions:
- Aborted spike after exceeding time limit
- Deleted spike/upgrade-mathlib-4.4 branch
- Continuing with Milestone C implementation on mathlib 4.3.0
