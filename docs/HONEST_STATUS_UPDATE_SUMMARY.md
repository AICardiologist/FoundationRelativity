# Honest Status Update Summary - August 7, 2025

## Purpose
This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation update performed on August 7, 2025, to correct major inaccuracies in project status claims.

## Critical Discoveries

### Paper 2: Sorry Counting Corrections
- **Initial Documentation**: 6 honest sorries, substantially complete
- **First Correction**: 17 unresolved sorries (including documentation comments)
- **FINAL ACCURATE COUNT**: 11 actual code sorries/admits with 2 critical infrastructure blockers
- **Impact**: More manageable scope than initially assessed, but still substantial work

### Documentation Corrections Made

#### Updated Files:
1. **`Papers/P2_BidualGap/README.md`** - Complete rewrite with honest assessment
2. **`docs/planning/PAPER2_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`** - Realistic 10-12 week timeline
3. **`SORRY_ALLOWLIST.txt`** - Accurate sorry counts and descriptions
4. **`docs/README.md`** - Corrected project overview
5. **`docs/PAPER2_FINAL_STATUS.md`** - Reality-based status assessment
6. **`docs/planning/project-status.md`** - Major revision with honest statistics
7. **`docs/CODE_REFERENCE.md`** - Added accuracy disclaimers
8. **`docs/onboarding.md`** - Corrected quick start summary

#### Archive Created:
- **`docs/archive/obsolete-2025-08-07-honest-update/`** - For future reference

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Regular Verification Essential
Previous status claims were based on outdated analyses. Regular comprehensive code examination is essential.

### 2. Infrastructure Constraints Underestimated  
Technical blockers like heartbeat timeouts and mathlib version issues can prevent substantial progress.

### 3. Cascade Dependencies Critical
Many sorries depend on resolving core infrastructure issues - these dependencies were not properly tracked.

### 4. Timeline Estimation Issues
Previous estimates didn't account for:
- Expert consultation requirements
- Infrastructure constraint resolution time
- Mathematical complexity of remaining work

## Current Honest Status (August 2025)

### ✅ Actually Complete:
- **Paper 1**: 0 sorries, fully verified

### ⚠️ Major Gaps Remaining:
- **Paper 2**: 11 actual code sorries/admits, requires 10-12 weeks expert work
- **Paper 3**: 6 sorries, status needs comprehensive analysis
- **Paper 4**: 71 sorries, ongoing discrete implementation

### 📊 Corrected Project Statistics:
- **Total sorries**: 104 (revised from initial 110, corrected from 78)
- **Completion**: ~42% (more manageable than initially assessed)
- **Timeline to completion**: 6-12 months with proper resources

## Going Forward

### Documentation Standards:
1. **Match claims to code**: All status claims must be verified against actual implementation
2. **Conservative estimates**: Timeline estimates should account for complexity and dependencies
3. **Regular audits**: Comprehensive status checks every 4-6 weeks
4. **Honest sorry counting**: Direct code analysis, no estimation or outdated counts

### Resource Planning:
1. **Expert consultation essential**: Infrastructure blockers require specialized expertise
2. **Realistic scheduling**: Account for expert availability and complexity
3. **Dependency tracking**: Map sorry dependencies to avoid cascade failures

## Archive Policy
Files should be archived when:
- Status claims are found to be substantially inaccurate
- Timeline estimates prove unrealistic by >100%
- Completion claims are contradicted by code analysis
- Any documentation that could mislead about actual project status

This update establishes a foundation of honest, accurate documentation for future development.
