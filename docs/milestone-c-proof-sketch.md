# Milestone C Proof Sketch

## SpectralGap Pathology (ρ=3) Requires ACω

### Constructive Impossibility
**Chain**: `Selector → WLPO → ACω → RequiresACω`
- Assume a selector that finds eigenvectors in spectral gaps for any operator
- Construct diagonal operators `T[b]` from boolean sequences `b : ℕ → Bool`  
- Use classical reasoning to derive WLPO (Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience)
- Bridge WLPO to countable choice ACω via existing classical infrastructure

### Classical Witness  
**Existence**: Zero operator has explicit eigenvector `zeroWitness := e 0`
- Concrete unit vector at index 0 in ℓ² space
- Satisfies eigenvalue equation: `0 · zeroWitness = 0`
- Proves non-emptiness of zero eigenspace classically

### Mathematical Achievement
**Duality**: Constructively impossible, yet classically witnessed - the essence of Foundation-Relativity ρ-degree hierarchy.
