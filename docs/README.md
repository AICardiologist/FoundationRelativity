# Foundation-Relativity Documentation

> **⚠️ CRITICAL HONEST STATUS UPDATE**: This project has been comprehensively reviewed and documentation updated to reflect actual implementation status as of August 2025.

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Foundation-Relativity project, a Lean 4 formalization exploring how mathematical pathologies behave differently under various foundational assumptions.

> **🚨 IMPORTANT**: Previous documentation contained overly optimistic claims. This version provides accurate status assessments based on thorough code analysis.

## 🎯 HONEST Current Project Status

### ✅ Actually Completed Papers
1. **Paper 1: Gödel-Banach Correspondence** - Complete with 0 sorries ✅

### ⚠️ Papers With Major Mathematical Gaps
2. **Paper 2: Bidual Gap Construction** - **INCOMPLETE: 11 actual code sorries/admits**
   - Main theorem compiles but uses mathematical placeholders
   - 2 critical infrastructure blockers preventing cascade progress
   - Requires 10-12 weeks expert consultation for completion
3. **Paper 3: 2-Categorical Framework** - **STATUS UNKNOWN: 6 sorries**
   - Need comprehensive analysis similar to Paper 2
   - Previous "completed" claims were inaccurate

### 📋 In Progress  
**Paper 4: Spectral Geometry** - Discrete CPW model implementation
- Phase 1A infrastructure complete ✅
- 71 sorries in discrete implementation (honest count)
- Realistic timeline: 12-15 weeks with proper resource allocation
