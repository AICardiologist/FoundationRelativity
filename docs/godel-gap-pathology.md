# Gödel-Gap Pathology (ρ ≈ 4½-5)

**Sprint 37 - Foundation-Relativity Phase IV**

## Overview

The **Gödel-Gap pathology** represents the culmination of the Foundation-Relativity hierarchy, achieving logical strength ρ ≈ 4½-5 through a rank-one Fredholm operator whose surjectivity encodes a Π⁰₂ Gödel sentence.

## Mathematical Structure

### Operator Definition

The Gödel-Gap operator is defined as:
```
F v := v - ⟨v,g⟩·u
```

Where:
- `u`: Normalized vector with coefficients `2^{-(n+1)}`, ‖u‖ = 1
- `g`: Gödel-encoded vector with `g(n) = 1` if `halt(n)`, else `2^{-(n+1)}`
- `halt`: Primitive recursive predicate encoding a Turing machine

### Key Properties

1. **Rank-one structure**: F = Id - P where P is a rank-one projection
2. **Self-adjoint**: F† = F (Hermitian operator)
3. **Bounded**: ‖F‖ ≤ 2
4. **Surjectivity criterion**: F is onto ⟺ ∃k, halt(k) = true

## Logical Strength

### Constructive Impossibility

The selector `Sel₃` yields enhanced WLPO (WLPO⁺⁺) for Π⁰₂ statements:
```lean
theorem wlpoPlusPlus_of_sel₃ : Sel₃ → WLPOPlusPlus
```

### Classical Witness

In ZFC, the selector exists via dependent choice on the halt predicate.

### Bridge Theorem

The pathology requires DC_{ω·3} (Π⁰₂-reflection):
```lean
theorem GodelGap_requires_DCω3 : RequiresDCω3 (Sel₃)
```

## Foundation-Relativity Implications

This pathology bridges:
- **Undecidability** (Gödel incompleteness)
- **Spectral analysis** (operator theory)
- **Logical strength** (DC_{ω·3})

Placing it at the apex of the ρ-hierarchy as the first formal connection between Gödel phenomena and spectral gaps.
