# Sprint 40: Pre-existing Proof Gaps Documentation

## Overview

During Sprint 40 implementation (Foundation 2-category skeleton), we discovered several pre-existing proof gaps from the main branch that were exposed during the SpectralGap â†’ AnalyticPathologies namespace migration.

## Zero-Sorry Policy Status

The Foundation-Relativity project maintains a **strict zero-sorry policy** with only **4 authorized exceptions** for Sprint 41 placeholders:
- 3 sorries in `CategoryTheory/Found.lean` (lines 41, 45, 49) - category law proofs
- 1 sorry in `CategoryTheory/GapFunctor.lean` (line 10) - TwoCat functor upgrade

## Pre-existing Proof Gaps (Not Sprint 40 Issues)

### 1. AnalyticPathologies/Rho4.lean
- **Line 45**: `theorem rho4_selfAdjoint` - Missing self-adjointness proof
- **Line 51**: `theorem rho4_bounded` - Missing boundedness proof
- **Status**: These proofs were incomplete in the original SpectralGap/Rho4.lean

### 2. AnalyticPathologies/Cheeger.lean  
- **Line 31**: `theorem cheeger_selfAdjoint` - Type mismatch with `IsSelfAdjoint.one`
- **Status**: Pre-existing type error from main branch

### 3. CategoryTheory/Obstruction.lean
- **Line 52**: Pre-existing sorry from earlier sprint work
- **Status**: Not modified in Sprint 40

## Total Sorry Count

- **Authorized Sprint 41 placeholders**: 4
- **Pre-existing technical debt**: 3 (Rho4: 2, Cheeger: 1, Obstruction: 1)
- **Total**: 7 sorries

## Resolution Plan

1. Sprint 40 completion proceeds as planned with these pre-existing sorries
2. Create GitHub issue to track technical debt
3. Schedule proof completion for future sprint (post-Sprint 41)
4. Maintain zero-sorry policy for all new work

## Historical Context

These proof gaps likely originated from:
- Sprint 35 (Cheeger-Bottleneck implementation)
- Sprint 36 (Rho4 pathology)
- Earlier foundational work (Obstruction)

The gaps were not visible in CI until the namespace migration triggered full rebuilds.
