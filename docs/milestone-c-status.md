# Milestone C Status Report

**Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Sprint**: S6 Sprint 34  

## Completed Tasks

### 1. LogicDSL Implementation ✓
- Created `SpectralGap/LogicDSL.lean` with:
  - `RequiresACω` inductive proposition
  - `ACω` definition for countable choice
  - `acω_from_requires` theorem (placeholder)
  
### 2. NoWitness Update ✓  
- Updated `SpectralGap/NoWitness.lean` with:
  - Import of LogicDSL
  - `zeroGap_requiresACω` theorem (placeholder)
  
### 3. Test Updates ✓
- Updated `test/SpectralGapProofTest.lean` with Milestone C confirmations
- Fixed CI issues with ToString instance

### 4. Build Configuration ✓
- ASCII `Nat` used instead of Unicode ℕ per Math-AI instructions
- Placeholder proofs with `sorry` for CI green status

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **Unicode Issue**: Changed ℕ to ASCII Nat in LogicDSL
2. **Classical Tactic**: Replaced with `sorry` placeholder as instructed
3. **CI Failures**: Fixed ToString instance problem in tests

## Attempted Tasks

### Mathlib 4.4 Upgrade Spike (Aborted)
- **Branch**: spike/upgrade-mathlib-4.4 (deleted)
- **Result**: Exceeded 30-minute time box due to build times
- **Action**: Aborted per Math-AI instructions, created retro documentation

## Current State

- All Milestone C groundwork is implemented and committed
- CI should pass with placeholder proofs
- Ready for Milestone D constructive impossibility proofs
- Technical debt TD-B-001 remains for spectrum proof

## Next Steps

Per Math-AI Sprint 34 instructions:
1. Wait for CI to complete and confirm green status
2. Open PR if requested
3. Begin Milestone D constructive proofs when ready

## Files Modified

- `SpectralGap/LogicDSL.lean` - New logic DSL framework
- `SpectralGap/NoWitness.lean` - Updated with RequiresACω
- `test/SpectralGapProofTest.lean` - Added Milestone C confirmations
- `docs/retro-mathlib-4.4-spike.md` - Spike retrospective
