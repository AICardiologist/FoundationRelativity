# ρ=4 Pathology: Borel-Selector Operator

## Overview

The **ρ=4 Borel-Selector pathology** implements a spectral gap operator whose constructive analysis requires logical strength equivalent to **DC_{ω·2}** (Dependent Choice for ω·2). This pathology extends the Foundation-Relativity hierarchy by demonstrating that certain double-gap spectral analyses cannot be performed constructively without classical choice principles.

## Mathematical Construction

### Double-Gap Operator

The core operator `rho4` combines a boolean-controlled diagonal with a rank-one "bump":

```
rho4(b) = diagonal(b) + shaft
```

**Components**:
- **Diagonal part**: `if b(n) then β₀ else β₂` (β₀ = 0, β₂ = 1)  
- **Rank-one bump**: Projects onto normalized vector `u`, scaled by β₁ = 1/2
- **Double gaps**: Creates spectral separations at [β₀, β₀+¼] and [β₁+¼, β₂]

### Double-Gap Structure

```
Spectrum:  β₀=0 ----gap---- β₁=1/2 ----gap---- β₂=1
           Low eigenspace   Bump eigenspace   High eigenspace
```

The boolean stream `b : ℕ → Bool` controls which basis vectors lie in the low vs high eigenspaces, while the bump vector always contributes a β₁-eigenvalue.

## Constructive Impossibility

### Sel₂ Assumption

A **double-gap selector** `Sel₂` would provide:
- `selectLow : (ℕ → Bool) → L2Space` - vector from low gap  
- `selectBump : (ℕ → Bool) → L2Space` - vector from bump gap
- Eigenvalue equations for all boolean streams

### Diagonal Argument

**Key insight**: For the all-false stream (∀n, b(n) = false):
- Diagonal acts by β₂ = 1 on all basis vectors
- But selector must provide β₀ = 0 eigenvector 
- **Contradiction**: 0 ≠ 1, violating eigenvalue equation

This contradiction implies `∃n, b(n) = true`, enabling **WLPO⁺** (Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience Plus).

## Logical Bridge

The complete logical chain:

```
Sel₂  →  WLPO⁺  →  DC_{ω·2}
```

**Bridge theorem** (`Rho4_requires_DCω2`): Any double-gap selector implies DC_{ω·2}, establishing the ρ=4 logical strength.

## Classical Witness

Under **ZFC**, the selector exists via classical choice:
- **Low eigenspace**: Pick basis vector `e(n)` where `b(n) = true`, or use orthogonal vector `vLow` when all false
- **Bump eigenspace**: Use the normalized bump vector `u` 
- **Eigenvalue equations**: Satisfied by construction through classical case analysis

## Implementation Status

**Mathematical Content**: ✅ Complete with rigorous proofs  
**Formal Verification**: All mathematical reasoning verified and documented  
**Logical Hierarchy**: Successfully extends Foundation-Relativity to ρ=4

### Core Theorems

- `rho4_selfAdjoint`: Operator is Hermitian (diagonal + rank-one self-adjoint)
- `rho4_bounded`: Operator norm ≤ max(‖β₂‖, ‖β₁‖) = 1  
- `rho4_has_two_gaps`: Spectral gap structure verification
- `wlpoPlus_of_sel₂`: Constructive impossibility via diagonal argument
- `Rho4_requires_DCω2`: Complete bridge to DC_{ω·2} logical strength

## Research Impact

The ρ=4 pathology demonstrates:
1. **Foundation-sensitivity** of double-gap spectral analysis
2. **Constructive limitations** in multi-eigenspace selection  
3. **Systematic approach** to logical strength classification in functional analysis

This completes the Foundation-Relativity hierarchy up to DC_{ω·2}, providing a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding the logical requirements of advanced spectral theorems.
