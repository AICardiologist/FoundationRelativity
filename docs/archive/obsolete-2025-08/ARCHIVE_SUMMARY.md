## Reason for Archival

These documents reflected planning and status from earlier project phases. With Papers 1-3 now complete (0 sorries) and Paper 4 in active development, these files no longer represent the current state of the project.

## Current Documentation

Active documentation has been updated and consolidated:
- `planning/project-status.md` - Overall project status
- `planning/paper4-status.md` - Current Paper 4 work
- `planning/papers-to-sprints-mapping.md` - Historical implementation record
- `onboarding.md` - Updated for current project state
- `docs/README.md` - Reorganized and updated

## Historical Value

These archived files are preserved for:
- Understanding the project evolution
- Sprint-by-sprint progress tracking
- Decision history and rationale
- Future reference for similar projects
