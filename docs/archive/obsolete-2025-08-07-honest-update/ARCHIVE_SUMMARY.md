# Archive Summary - Honest Status Update (2025-08-07)

## Purpose
This folder contains documentation that became outdated after the comprehensive honest status assessment of August 7, 2025, which revealed major inaccuracies in previous claims about project completion status.

## Key Findings from Honest Assessment
- **Paper 2**: Previously claimed "6 honest sorries" but actually has **17 unresolved sorries**
- **Paper 2**: Main theorem compiles but relies on mathematical placeholders (`admit`)
- **Infrastructure**: 2 critical blockers prevent all cascade progress 
- **Timeline**: Previous estimates were overly optimistic by 200-300%

## Major Documentation Corrections Made
1. **Paper 2 README**: Complete rewrite with honest status assessment
2. **Paper 2 Implementation Roadmap**: Corrected from 5-week to 10-12-week realistic timeline
3. **SORRY_ALLOWLIST**: Updated with accurate counts and honest descriptions
4. **Project Status**: Major revision removing inaccurate completion claims
5. **Paper 2 Final Status**: Corrected previous optimistic assessments

## Files That May Become Obsolete
Any documentation claiming:
- Paper 2 is "substantially complete" or "nearly done"
- Paper 2 has only 6 sorries or similar low counts
- Papers 2-3 are ready for publication
- Project completion estimates under 6 months
- Claims about "successful implementation" of incomplete work

## Lesson Learned
This archive serves as a reminder of the importance of:
- Regular comprehensive code analysis rather than relying on outdated assessments
- Honest documentation that matches actual implementation status
- Conservative timeline estimates based on actual complexity
- Verification of claims through direct code examination

## Future Archive Policy
Documentation should be archived here when:
- Major status reassessments reveal significant inaccuracies
- Timelines or completion estimates prove substantially wrong
- Claims about mathematical completeness are found to be inaccurate
- Any documentation that could mislead about actual project status

This ensures the project maintains accurate, honest documentation going forward.
