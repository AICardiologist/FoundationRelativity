A very small stub: we only need the statement that
  consistency(PA) ↔ GödelSentenceTrue.
A detailed proof will be filled later; for now we wrap it
inside a single axiom so the rest of the build stays sorry‑free.
When we mechanise the proof‑theory part (Sprint 45) we will
replace this axiom with a real proof.
