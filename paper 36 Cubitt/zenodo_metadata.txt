TITLE:
Stratifying Spectral Gap Undecidability: Cubitt's Theorem Is LPO (Paper 36, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

DESCRIPTION:
Paper 36 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics of Mathematical Physics series. The celebrated result of Cubitt, Perez-Garcia, and Wolf (2015) showed that determining whether a many-body quantum Hamiltonian is gapped or gapless is undecidable. This paper calibrates that undecidability as Turing-Weihrauch equivalent to LPO (the Limited Principle of Omniscience). The key insight is that the macroscopic quantum undecidability costs exactly one thermodynamic limit --- the same logical price paid for phase transitions, continuum limits, and all other infinite-volume completions across physics. The stratification reveals: finite-volume spectral gap is BISH-computable, the thermodynamic limit costs LPO, pointwise decidability requires LPO, gap zero-test costs WLPO (subsumed by LPO), and uniform decidability costs LPO. All results formalized in Lean 4 over Mathlib with zero sorry. The formalization comprises 8 Lean source files.
