# Foundation-Relativity Formalization Status

Last Updated: 2025-08-04

## Overview

This document provides an honest assessment of the formalization status across all papers. Following senior professor guidance, we prioritize integrity over metrics.

## Paper 1: Foundation-Relativistic Theorem Verification

**Status**: ‚úì Complete (0 sorries)
- Core theorem verified
- Bicategorical framework established
- No Unit tricks or placeholder types

## Paper 2: Bidual Gap ‚Üî WLPO

**Status**: üöß In Progress (4 + ~55 sorries)

### Working Files (4 sorries)
- `Basic.lean` - WLPO definition corrected (1 sorry for BidualGap placeholder)
- `Logic/WLPOBasic.lean` - Clean WLPO definition (0 sorries)
- `MainTheoremSimple.lean` - Theorem statement (2 sorries)
- Supporting files compile

### Constructive Framework (~55 sorries)
- `Constructive/CReal.lean` - Being refactored to regular reals
- `Constructive/Sequences.lean` - Witness sequence in progress
- `Constructive/HahnBanach.lean` - One-step extension needed
- `Constructive/MainTheorem.lean` - Full proof structure

### Critical Issues Addressed
- ‚ùå **Unit/() tricks removed** - Previous "0 sorries" claim was fraudulent
- ‚úì **WLPO properly defined** as logical proposition
- ‚úì **Honest sorry markers** for incomplete proofs

## Paper 3: Quantitative Œµ-Foundations

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Under Review
- May contain Unit tricks (needs audit)
- Depends on Paper 2 framework

## Paper 4: Functorial Foundations

**Status**: üìã Planning Phase
- Design complete
- Implementation pending

## Key Metrics

| Paper | Claimed Sorries | Actual Sorries | Unit Tricks |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1     | 0              | 0              | None        |
| 2     | 0*             | ~59            | Removed     |
| 3     | TBD            | TBD            | Under Audit |
| 4     | N/A            | N/A            | N/A         |

*Previous claim based on Unit tricks - now corrected

## Integrity Statement

Following senior professor guidance:
1. All Unit-based placeholder code has been identified and is being replaced
2. Sorry markers represent genuine mathematical work remaining
3. The constructive framework engages with real mathematical challenges
4. No attempt to hide incomplete work behind type tricks

## Next Steps

1. Complete refactoring to regular reals (senior professor recommendation)
2. Implement unnormalized witness sequence
3. Complete constructive Hahn-Banach one-step extension
4. Audit Paper 3 for similar issues

## Repository Guidelines

- Main branch contains only honest formalization
- Unit-based code archived in `deprecated/` with clear warnings
- All sorries documented with specific mathematical challenges
- Progress tracked transparently in this document
