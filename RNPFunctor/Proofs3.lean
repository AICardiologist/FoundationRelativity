# RNP_Fail₃ Proof (ρ=2+ Level)

This file proves that RNP_Fail₃ (separable-dual martingale variant) requires DC_{ω+1},
placing it at ρ=2+ level in the logical strength hierarchy.

The proof establishes three key theorems:
1. Constructive impossibility in bish foundations
2. Classical existence in zfc foundations  
3. Formal requirement of DC_{ω+1}

**Key differences from RNP_Fail₂:**
- Uses separable dual martingale support API
- Requires DC_{ω+1} instead of DC_ω
- Leverages existing Gap₂/AP_Fail₂ lemmas for half the groundwork
