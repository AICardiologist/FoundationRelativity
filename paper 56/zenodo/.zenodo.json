  "description": "<p>Paper 56 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics and Arithmetic Geometry series. We compute the self-intersection degree deg(w<sub>0</sub> &middot; w<sub>0</sub>) = &radic;disc(F) for exotic Weil classes on three CM abelian fourfolds of Weil type, providing explicit numerical evidence at the boundary of the Deligne&ndash;Poisson&ndash;Tate (DPT) conjecture.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong> (K = Q(&radic;-3), F = Q(&zeta;<sub>7</sub> + &zeta;<sub>7</sub><sup>-1</sup>)): disc(F) = 49, deg = 7.<br/>\n<strong>Example 2</strong> (K = Q(i), F = Q(&zeta;<sub>9</sub> + &zeta;<sub>9</sub><sup>-1</sup>)): disc(F) = 81, deg = 9.<br/>\n<strong>Example 3</strong> (K = Q(&radic;-7)): disc(F) = 169, deg = 13.</p>\n<p>All degrees are positive (Hodge&ndash;Riemann), all exotic Weil classes are algebraic (Schoen). The discriminant equation det(G) = disc(F) is exact, established via the cyclic conductor theorem. The 3&times;3 determinants are computed by <code>native_decide</code>.</p>\n<p>The Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization comprises 9 active modules + 2 deprecated (~1,666 lines total, ~1,331 active), compiles with zero errors, zero warnings, and zero sorry gaps. 10 principled axioms encode published results (Milne, Shimura, Schoen). Correction history: v2 (conductor-based) is current; v1/v3 discriminant equation deprecated.</p>\n<p>Code is distributed exclusively via this Zenodo record.</p>",
