  Papers.lean - Sprint 42 Math-AI coordination
  
  Paper formalization modules for Sprint 42 Math-AI collaboration.
  
  Structure:
  - P1_GBC: Grothendieck-Banach-Cheeger framework  
  - P2_BidualGap: Bidual gap analysis with bicategory structure
  - P3_2CatFramework: Complete 2-categorical witness framework
  
  Note: Individual SmokeTest modules are built as separate executables
  to avoid main function conflicts. This module provides documentation
  and coordination between paper streams.
