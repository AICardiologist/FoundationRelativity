  Paper formalization modules for Foundation-Relativity project.
  
  Structure:
  - P1_GBC: Rank-One Toggle Kernel (Sherman-Morrison implementation + stubs)
  - P2_BidualGap: WLPO â†” BidualGap equivalence (dual isometry complete)
  - P3_2CatFramework: 2-categorical foundation-relativity framework
  - P4_SpectralGeometry: Undecidable eigenvalue problems on manifolds
  
  Note: Individual minimal modules are built as separate executables.
  This provides coordination and documentation for all papers.
