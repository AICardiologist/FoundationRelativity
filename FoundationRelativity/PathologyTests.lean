  -------------------

  Quick smoke tests for the three analytic pathologies formalised
  in the project.

    •  Gap₂      – bidual‑gap functional         (ρ = 1 – WLPO)
    •  AP_Fail₂  – Johnson–Szankowski operator   (ρ = 1 – WLPO)
    •  RNP_Fail₂ – vector‑measure w/o derivative (ρ = 2 – DC_ω)

  The tests exercise witness types and foundation structure.
