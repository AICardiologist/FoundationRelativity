Foundation.bish ≠ Foundation.zfc : true
Foundation types: bish (constructive) and zfc (classical)
Checking witness type definitions:
Gap.Witness Foundation.bish     : Type
Gap.Witness Foundation.zfc      : Type
APFail.Witness Foundation.bish  : Type
APFail.Witness Foundation.zfc   : Type
RNPFail.Witness Foundation.bish : Type
RNPFail.Witness Foundation.zfc  : Type
Interpretation morphism defined:
Interp.forget : Interp Foundation.bish Foundation.zfc

✓ Gap pathology: bidual-gap functional (ρ = 1, needs WLPO)
✓ AP pathology: Johnson-Szankowski operator (ρ = 1, needs WLPO)
✓ RNP pathology: vector-measure w/o derivative (ρ = 2, needs DC_ω)
✓ Foundation types (bish vs zfc) distinguish constructive vs classical
✓ Witness types encode ρ-degree complexity: Empty (bish) vs PUnit (zfc)
✓ Foundation-Relativity framework successfully implemented
✓ Pathology tests completed successfully
