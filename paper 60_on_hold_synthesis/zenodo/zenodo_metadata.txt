Title:
  Decidability, Visibility, and the Architecture of Mathematical Truth: A Synthesis of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics Program (Paper 54, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

Description:
  Paper 54 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics series. This paper synthesizes the CRM program developed across Papers 1-53. The program calibrates mathematical theorems against logical principles — BISH, WLPO, LPO, MP, FT — revealing three structurally distinct obstructions to computation:

  (1) Logical obstructions (omniscience principles, Papers 2-31): theorems requiring excluded middle decompose into strata keyed to WLPO, LPO, and MP. The undecidability genealogy (Papers 29-42) advances the thesis that empirical physics requires exactly BISH+LPO: every physical undecidability result calibrated in the series is LPO-equivalent, traceable to Wang tiling. Markov's Principle governs the residual cost of physical actualization.

  (2) Geometric obstructions (visibility failures in the Lefschetz ring, Papers 52-53): in arithmetic geometry, the Standard Conjectures function as decidability axioms ensuring decidable equivalence relations on cycle spaces. The motive is a decidability certificate. The dimension-4 boundary for abelian varieties is sharp, confirmed computationally (deg(w . w) = 7 > 0).

  (3) Diophantine obstructions (irreducible Markov search, Papers 45-51): Diophantine problems require witness search that cannot be reduced to decidable tests, governed by MP rather than LPO.

  No new formal theorems are proved; this is an interpretive essay drawing on 53 papers, 12 with Lean 4 formalizations. It proposes novel interpretive frameworks — particularly the obstruction trichotomy and the de-omniscientizing descent pattern — that organize the prior results in ways not explicit in the individual papers.
