  "title": "The Weight-Monodromy Conjecture and LPO: Constructive Calibration of Spectral Sequence Degeneration via De-Omniscientizing Descent (Paper 45, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)",
  "description": "<p>Paper 45 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics series. We apply CRM to calibrate the logical strength of spectral sequence degeneration in the context of the Weight-Monodromy Conjecture (WMC) for smooth projective varieties over <em>p</em>-adic fields. We establish four theorems (C1&ndash;C4) that together constitute a constructive calibration of the Arithmetic Kashiwara Conjecture&mdash;the single remaining obstruction to the full WMC.</p>\n<p><strong>C1</strong> (Polarization &rArr; Degeneration in BISH): Hodge polarization forces degeneration via equational reasoning from positive-definiteness; no omniscience required. Full proof, no custom axioms.</p>\n<p><strong>C2</strong> (DecidesDegeneration(K) &harr; LPO(K)): Abstract spectral sequence degeneration decidability is exactly LPO for the coefficient field. Full proof, no custom axioms.</p>\n<p><strong>C3</strong> (Archimedean Positivity Obstruction): Over any <em>p</em>-adic field, no positive-definite Hermitian form exists in dimension &ge; 3, permanently blocking the polarization strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>C4</strong> (De-Omniscientizing Descent): For geometric perverse sheaves, degeneration is decidable in BISH. Geometric origin descends the coefficient field from undecidable Q&#8467; to decidable Q&#x0304;, replacing LPO with finite decidable equality.</p>\n<p>The Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization comprises 9 source files (~1,247 lines), compiles with zero errors, zero warnings, and zero sorry. Theorems C1 and C2 are full proofs; C3 and C4 derive consequences from explicitly documented axioms. Sub-lemma 5 (Arithmetic Kashiwara Conjecture) is a hypothesis parameter, not an axiom, preserving conditionality.</p>\n<p>Code is distributed exclusively via this Zenodo record.</p>",
