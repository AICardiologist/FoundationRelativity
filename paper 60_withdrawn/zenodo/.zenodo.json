  "title": "Analytic Rank Stratification of Mixed Motives: Completing the DPT Framework (Paper 60, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)",
  "description": "<p>Paper 60 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics series. We prove that the DPT framework for numerical equivalence on pure motives is complete: Axioms 1&ndash;3 plus automatic de Rham decidability (Paper 59) suffice. No mixed motive axiom is needed because numerical equivalence projects away from the kernel of the cycle class map.</p>\n<p>We then initiate the extended framework for rational equivalence by proving an analytic rank stratification theorem: the logical complexity of computing Ext<sup>1</sup>(&Qopf;(0), M) is determined by ord<sub>s=s<sub>0</sub></sub> L(M, s). For r = 0, exact verification is BISH (Ext<sup>1</sup> = 0). For r = 1, the L-function isolates a 1-dimensional regulator; Bloch&ndash;Kato bounds the height and Northcott bounds the search, yielding BISH (conditional on Bloch&ndash;Kato). For r &ge; 2, the L-function provides only a lattice covolume; by Minkowski&rsquo;s geometry of numbers, covolume cannot bound individual basis vectors in dimension &ge; 2, requiring Markov&rsquo;s Principle.</p>\n<p>The rank &ge; 2 obstruction is structural and removable only by Lang&rsquo;s Height Lower Bound Conjecture (open). The pure motive programme (Papers 50&ndash;59) and this mixed motive frontier together constitute the complete DPT framework.</p>\n<p>This paper has no Lean formalization &mdash; LaTeX and PDF only.</p>",
