# Paper 60 — RETIRED

## Status: Folded into Paper 59

Paper 60 ("Analytic Rank Stratification of Mixed Motives: Completing the DPT Framework") has been retired as a standalone paper. Its content has been folded into Paper 59 as:

- **§9.5** "DPT completeness for numerical equivalence" (Theorem 9.5)
- **§9.6** "The mixed motive frontier: analytic rank stratification" (Theorem 9.6)
- **§9.7** Open questions (merged with Paper 59's existing open questions)
- **§10** Conclusion (capstone paragraph added)

## Reason

The editor determined that Paper 60's content — a structural observation (completeness) and a CRM classification of known results (rank stratification) — does not bear the weight of a standalone paper. It works better as a discussion/conclusion section in Paper 59, which becomes the capstone of the pure motive programme.
