AUTHORS

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Paper 14 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics of Physics series.

This deposit contains the complete Lean 4 + Mathlib formalization of quantum decoherence calibrated against constructive omniscience principles, together with the accompanying paper (LaTeX source and compiled PDF).


MAIN RESULTS

Part A — BISH content (constructive, no omniscience):

  * decoherence_epsilon_bound: For any epsilon > 0 and interaction angle
    0 < theta < pi, there exists an explicitly computable N_0 such that
    the quantum coherence c(N) < epsilon for all N >= N_0.

  * coherence_eq_geometric: The coherence decays geometrically:
    c(N) = ||rho_01|| * |cos(theta/2)|^N.

  * decoherenceMap_eq_physical: The explicit decoherence formula equals
    the physical definition Phi(rho) = Tr_E[U(theta) (rho (x) |0><0|) U^dag(theta)],
    verified by brute-force 4x4 matrix computation.

Part B — LPO equivalence:

  * exact_decoherence_iff_LPO: The assertion "every bounded antitone
    sequence converges exactly" is equivalent to the Limited Principle
    of Omniscience (LPO).

  * abc_iff_bmc: Antitone Bounded Convergence <-> (monotone) Bounded
    Monotone Convergence, via sign-flip (fully proved, no axioms).


THREE DOMAINS, ONE LOGICAL STRUCTURE

This is the third physical domain producing the BMC <-> LPO pattern:

  Domain                    Bounded Monotone Sequence   LPO Content
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Statistical Mechanics (P8)   Free energy f_N          f_inf exists exactly
  General Relativity (P13)     Radial coordinate r(tau) r -> 0 exactly
  Quantum Measurement (P14)    Coherence c(N)           c -> 0 exactly (collapse)


AXIOM CERTIFICATE

  * BISH theorems: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] — standard
    Mathlib infrastructure only. No omniscience principles.

  * LPO theorems: Above plus bmc_of_lpo, lpo_of_bmc (axiomatized,
    citing Bridges-Vita 2006 and Paper 8).

  * Sign-flip lemma (abc_iff_bmc): Fully proved, no custom axioms.
