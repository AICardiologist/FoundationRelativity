TITLE:
Lang's Conjecture as the MP → BISH Gate: The Decidability Hierarchy for Mixed Motives (Lean 4 Formalization). (Paper 61, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

AUTHORS:
Lee, Paul C.-K.

DESCRIPTION / ABSTRACT:
Paper 59/60 established that the decidability of Ext^1(Q(0), M) for motives with the Northcott property is stratified by analytic rank: BISH for r ≤ 1, MP for r ≥ 2. We prove that an effective Lang Height Lower Bound Conjecture is the precise gate converting the rank ≥ 2 regime from MP to BISH, via inversion of Minkowski's Second Theorem. The implication is strict: BISH-decidability does not imply Lang, because constructive computability imposes no constraint on the geometric decay rate of minimal heights. We verify the forward direction explicitly for X_0(389) (rank 2). For motives lacking the Northcott property (K3 surfaces, higher K-theory), we prove the decidability requirement escalates from MP to LPO: verifying lattice completeness over an infinite bounded-height cycle space requires universal quantification equivalent to the Limited Principle of Omniscience. The full hierarchy is: BISH ⊊ MP ⊊ LPO, with Lang's conjecture gating MP → BISH and the Northcott property gating LPO → MP.

All theorems are formally verified in Lean 4 with Mathlib. Zero sorry. Zero custom axioms beyond Mathlib infrastructure and one open-conjecture axiom (UniformLang) used only for Theorem E.
