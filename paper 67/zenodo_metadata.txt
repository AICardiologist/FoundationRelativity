Description:

Every major conjecture in arithmetic geometry—Hodge, Tate, BSD, Fontaine-Mazur, Weight-Monodromy—has a precise logical address.  This monograph finds those addresses.

Working in Bishop's constructive mathematics (BISH), we ask a question that classical number theory never asks: how much omniscience does each conjecture actually cost?  The answer, assembled across thirty-one papers (Papers 45-75 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics series), is that the motive itself acts as a decidability certificate.  Geometric origin—the property that converts a cohomological datum into a cycle—systematically eliminates the need for the Limited Principle of Omniscience (LPO), reducing problems from undecidable to constructively solvable.  The programme's central finding—the logical cost of mathematics is the logical cost of R—is now established as a biconditional across all three DPT axioms (Papers 72-74) and validated externally against the Genestier-Lafforgue LLC (Paper 75).

THE CLASSIFICATION

Three invariants—analytic rank, Hodge level, and the effective Lang constant—classify every pure or mixed motive into a decidability tier: from BISH (fully constructive) through BISH + MP and BISH + WLPO, up to BISH + LPO (full omniscience).  All five great conjectures exhibit a uniform de-omniscientizing descent from LPO to BISH, mediated by the motive's geometry.  In cohomological dimension below 4, every calibrated conjecture descends to BISH; at dimension 4, the Hodge conjecture hits a wall requiring LPO.  At finite primes, p-adic precision is bounded by 2, making finite places computationally trivial and resolving the open "Axiom 5" question of the Decidable Polarized Tannakian (DPT) framework.

THE DISCOVERY

The constructive lens also found something classical mathematics missed entirely.  For CM abelian fourfolds, the self-intersection degree of the exotic Weil class satisfies an exact arithmetic identity: h * Nm(A) = f, where f is the conductor, A is the Steinitz ideal class, and h is the Hermitian self-pairing.  This identity holds across all nine principal Heegner fields, generalizes to 1,220 field pairs with zero exceptions, and extends to non-cyclic cubics through the trace-zero lattice form class.  The identity was invisible at classical resolution—it required the constructive proof's finer granularity to see.

FORMAL VERIFICATION

Approximately sixty-five papers in the series carry Lean 4 + Mathlib formalizations totaling over 89,000 lines.  The verification corpus is summarized in Table 2.

STRUCTURE

Part I  — The Map: Decidable Polarized Tannakian (DPT) framework, de-omniscientizing descent, dimension-4 wall, p-adic resolution, mixed motive frontier.
Part II — The Identity: the h = f discovery, Steinitz generalization, computational verification at scale, form-class extension to non-cyclic cubics.
Part III — The Architecture: FLT is BISH (Paper 68), function field comparison (Paper 69), Archimedean Principle (Paper 70), DPT biconditional trilogy (Papers 72-74), conservation test (Paper 75), remaining open questions.

NOTES

This paper was produced with AI assistance (Anthropic Claude) for computation, literature search, and manuscript preparation.  All mathematical claims are either formally verified in Lean 4 (in constituent papers) or explicitly flagged as unverified.

The author is a practicing cardiologist and not a professional mathematician.  All claims should be evaluated on their formal content rather than on the author's credentials.
