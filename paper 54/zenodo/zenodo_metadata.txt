DESCRIPTION:
Paper 54 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics series. First out-of-sample test of the Decidability-Preserving Transfer (DPT) framework, calibrating the Bloch-Kato conjecture against DPT axioms.

Key results: (A) LPO isolation for zero-testing: analytic evaluation is computable but zero-testing requires LPO. (B) Axiom 2 realized by Deligne Weil I: Frobenius eigenvalues have prescribed absolute value. (C) Axiom 3 partial: Hodge-Riemann unconditional, Beilinson height pairing conditional. (D) Axiom 1 fails for mixed motives: Ext^1 decidability is not available. (E) p-adic Tamagawa obstruction: u-invariant of Q_p forces isotropy. (F) Descent diagram assembles the full calibration verdict with explicit fracture points.

The Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization comprises 8 source files (1,139 lines), compiles with zero errors, zero warnings, and zero sorry gaps. 7 principled axioms encode deep published results (Deligne Weil I, Hodge-Riemann, Bridges-Richman) and one conjecture (Beilinson).

Code is distributed exclusively via this Zenodo record.
