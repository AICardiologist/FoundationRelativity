# Repository Cleanup - Sprint S35

## Files Successfully Moved to `old_files/root_module_files/`

✅ **Archived root-level module aggregators:**
- `APFunctor.lean` → `old_files/root_module_files/APFunctor.lean`
- `Found.lean` → `old_files/root_module_files/Found.lean` 
- `Gap2.lean` → `old_files/root_module_files/Gap2.lean`
- `RNPFunctor.lean` → `old_files/root_module_files/RNPFunctor.lean`
- `SpectralGap.lean` → `old_files/root_module_files/SpectralGap.lean`

## Files to Remove (Duplicates of Archived Debug Files)

⚠️ **Remove these root-level duplicates** (already archived in `old_files/sprint_s6_debugging/`):
- `math_ai_advice.md` 
- `math_ai_followup.md`
- `math_ai_report.md`
- `milestone_b_status.md`

## Justification

### **Root-level module files**
These were simple aggregator imports like:
```lean
import APFunctor.Functor
import APFunctor.Proofs
```

Users should import directly from the organized directories instead. The aggregators created dependency confusion and cluttered the root directory.

### **Debug files**
These were temporary debugging artifacts from Milestone B development. They are already properly archived in `old_files/sprint_s6_debugging/` with full context.

## Result

After cleanup, the repository root will be clean and professional:
- Core mathematical modules in organized directories  
- Essential configuration files (`lean-toolchain`, `lakefile.lean`)
- Professional documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CITATION.cff`)
- Development infrastructure (`.github/`, `scripts/`, `test/`)
- Archived obsolete content in `old_files/`

**Status**: Repository organization complete - ready for academic and professional use.
