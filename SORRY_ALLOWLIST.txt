# Paper 2 - Bidual Gap ↔ WLPO (INCOMPLETE - 11 actual code sorries/admits)

Papers/P1_GBC/SmokeTest.lean:19  # Comment: "- No sorry statements in basic infrastructure"

# GRAND TOTAL: 108 authorized sorries (UPDATED 2025-08-08 - includes 4 documentation comments)
# - Paper 1: 0 (COMPLETE!) ✓ 
# - Paper 2: 11 (INCOMPLETE - 2 infrastructure blockers + 9 cascade dependencies)
# - Paper 3: 6 (all new from Unit cleanup)  
# - Paper 4: 71 (69 original + 2 updated)
# - Core infrastructure: 5
# - Comment references: 2 (reduced from 3)
# 
# CORRECTED UPDATE: Paper 2 count was overcounted in previous versions  
# REALITY: Paper 2 has 11 actual code sorries/admits (not 17) and is mathematically INCOMPLETE
# - Previous count included documentation comments mentioning "sorry" rather than actual code statements
# - IMPORTANT DISTINCTION: Comments mentioning "sorry" are NOT the same as executable sorry statements
# - Only executable `sorry` and `admit` statements in proof contexts count toward the mathematical gaps
# - gap_equiv_WLPO theorem statement compiles but relies on mathematical placeholders
# - gap_implies_wlpo: complete classical proof (works)
# - wlpo_implies_gap: uses admit placeholder due to mathlib version constraints
# - Foundation framework has 1 infrastructure-blocked sorry preventing cascade resolution
# - 9 additional sorries depend on resolving the 2 critical infrastructure blockers
# 
# STATUS: Work in progress with substantial mathematical gaps requiring expert consultation (more manageable scope than initially assessed)
