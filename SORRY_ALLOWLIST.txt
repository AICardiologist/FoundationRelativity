# SORRY_ALLOWLIST.txt
# Authorized sorry statements for Foundation-Relativity project

# Updated: 2025-07-31 (Sprint 45 - Reduced Core.lean sorries from 5 to 4) 
# Policy: ANY sorry outside this list will fail CI

Papers/P1_GBC/Correspondence.lean:22  # Comment: "-- already available; no `sorry`"
Papers/P1_GBC/SmokeTest.lean:19      # Comment: "- No sorry statements in basic infrastructure"

# TOTAL: 18 actual sorry statements + 3 comment references
# This represents the sprint 45 mathematical sorry elimination baseline
# Successfully reduced from 5 to 4 sorries in Core.lean by eliminating continuous_apply_coord
