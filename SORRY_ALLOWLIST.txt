# SORRY_ALLOWLIST.txt
# Authorized sorry statements for Foundation-Relativity project

# Updated: 2025-08-01 (Sprint 45 - Reduced Core.lean sorries from 4 to 3) 
# Policy: ANY sorry outside this list will fail CI

# Sprint 46: GÃ¶del-Banach Correspondence - Mathematical sorry elimination continues
# These represent the mathematical content before sorry elimination improvements

# TOTAL: 24 actual sorry statements + 3 comment references  
# This represents the sprint 45 mathematical sorry elimination baseline
# Successfully reduced from 4 to 3 sorries in Core.lean by eliminating G_surjective_iff_not_provable
