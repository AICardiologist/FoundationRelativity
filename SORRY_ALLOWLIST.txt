# SORRY_ALLOWLIST.txt
# Authorized sorry statements for Foundation-Relativity project

# Updated: 2025-07-31 (Sprint 45 - Core.lean Sorry Elimination)
# Policy: ANY sorry outside this list will fail CI

# Sprint 45: Successfully eliminated 4 sorries from Core.lean
# 28 intentional mathematical gaps representing genuine mathematical content
# These will be resolved in focused future sprints (45-46)

# TOTAL: 28 actual sorry statements + 3 comment references for Sprint 45 mathematical content
# Sprint 45 Status: Core.lean infrastructure complete, 4 sorries eliminated
# Next: Sprint 46 (Fredholm Theory), Sprint 47 (Main Correspondence Theorem)
