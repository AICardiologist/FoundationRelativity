# SORRY_ALLOWLIST.txt
# Authorized sorry statements for Foundation-Relativity project

# Updated: 2025-08-01 (Sprint 47 - Reduced Auxiliaries.lean sorries from 7 to 5) 
# Policy: ANY sorry outside this list will fail CI

# TOTAL: 22 actual sorry statements + 3 comment references  
# Sprint 47 eliminated 2 sorries from Auxiliaries.lean  
# This represents the sprint 45 mathematical sorry elimination baseline
# Successfully reduced from 4 to 3 sorries in Core.lean by eliminating G_surjective_iff_not_provable
