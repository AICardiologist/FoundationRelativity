TITLE:
Scattering Amplitudes Are Constructively Computable: Bhabha Scattering, Feynman Integrals, and the Fixed-Order Cross Section in BISH (Paper 34, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

DESCRIPTION:
Paper 34 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics of Mathematical Physics series. This paper proves that fixed-order scattering cross sections --- the quantities directly measured at particle collider experiments --- are fully BISH-computable (constructive, no omniscience). A six-tier stratification classifies every operation in a standard QED calculation: tree-level amplitudes (BISH), dilogarithm and special functions (BISH), dimensional regularization with MS-bar subtraction (BISH), Bloch-Nordsieck infrared cancellation (BISH), the inclusive fixed-order cross section (BISH, the main result), and all-orders perturbative summation (LPO via bounded monotone convergence). The result implies that every number a collider experiment actually reports lives in BISH --- the classical-logic cost of particle physics is entirely an artifact of attempting to sum an infinite perturbative series, not of computing any individual prediction. All results formalized in Lean 4 over Mathlib with zero sorry. The formalization comprises 8 Lean source files.
