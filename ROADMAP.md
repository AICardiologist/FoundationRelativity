## üî¨ Technical Architecture Insights

### Why P4_Meta Progress is Smoother
- **Deliberate abstraction**: Schematic language (atoms only) avoids heavy unification
- **Capabilities over commitments**: Classical dependencies isolated as axioms/typeclasses  
- **Certificates, not derivations**: HeightCertificate enables compositional reasoning
- **Local composability**: concatSteps, product/sup enable modular assembly
- **Normal forms**: StepNF provides canonical representation with automatic simplification

### Key Design Patterns
- **PUnit pivot technique**: Avoids cast issues in Equiv proofs
- **Typeclass preservation**: HBL/RE preserved through Extend automatically
- **Monotonicity infrastructure**: ExtendIter_le_mono enables systematic lifting
- **Transport operations**: Certificates move between pointwise-equal step functions
- **@[simp] automation**: Definitional equalities for frictionless stage arithmetic
- **Elementary proofs**: concat_left_nest_eq uses only core Nat lemmas (no fragile tactics)
- **Provenance discipline**: Classical vs Lean-proved results tracked
