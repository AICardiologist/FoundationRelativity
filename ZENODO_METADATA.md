## Description
Lean 4 formalization proving the equivalence between the Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience (WLPO) and the existence of Banach spaces with bidual gaps. This release contains the minimal reproducible build with the Option-B core theorem proven sorry-free.

### Key Results
- **Option-B Core Theorem**: HasNonzeroQuotFunctional + QuotToGapBridge ⇒ GapX (0 sorries)
- **Witness Space**: c₀ (sequences vanishing at infinity)  
- **Dual Isometry**: (c₀ →L[ℝ] ℝ) ≃ₗᵢ ℓ¹ implementation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated verification with 0 errors

### Contents
- Complete Paper 2 formalization under `Papers/P2_BidualGap/`
- Option-B framework with typeclass-based architecture
- Minimal build target compiling with 0 sorries
- Supporting build infrastructure and CI workflows
