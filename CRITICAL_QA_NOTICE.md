# üö® CRITICAL QA NOTICE - MUST READ üö®

**Date:** 2025-08-03  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**For:** All Claude Code agents working on this repository

## Executive Summary

**ALL THREE PAPERS (1, 2, and 3) have significant formalization issues despite claims of "0 sorries".**

- **Paper 1 (Survey & Approach)**: ~75% genuinely formalized, but contains 12 "cheap proofs" using Unit tricks, including the main Survey Theorem and key Reflection lemmas
- **Paper 2 (Bidual Gap)**: NOT formalized - only skeletal placeholder files with empty structures
- **Paper 3 (2-Categorical Framework)**: NOT formalized - only placeholder stubs

The current Lean codebase achieves "0 sorries" by replacing real mathematics with empty structures (`structure ... where dummy : Unit`) and vacuous proofs (`cases gap`, `use ‚ü®()‚ü©`, `exact ‚ü®()‚ü©`, etc.). 

**The "0 sorries" badge is misleading** - these papers do not verify the actual mathematical statements proven in the LaTeX manuscripts.

## Current Reality vs Claims

### What the Repository Claims
- All three papers are "fully formalized" with "0 sorries"
- README explicitly lists Papers 2 and 3 as complete

### Actual State
| Paper | LaTeX Content | Lean Reality | Verdict |
|-------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Paper 1 | Survey & foundational principles | ~75% genuine proofs, 12 "cheap" proofs using Unit tricks | Partially complete |
| Paper 2 | 30-page functional analysis, bidual gap ‚Üî WLPO | Empty structures, trivial proofs by `‚ü®()‚ü©` | **NOT formalized** |
| Paper 3 | Full 2-categorical framework, GPS coherence | Placeholder stubs only | **NOT formalized** |

### Key Problems Identified

1. **Unit Stub Pattern**: Definitions like:
   ```lean
   structure BidualGap where
     dummy : Unit
   ```
   Instead of actual mathematical content

2. **Vacuous Proofs**: Main theorems "proved" by:
   ```lean
   -- Paper 1 Survey Theorem:
   theorem survey_theorem : ... := by
     exact ‚ü®()‚ü©  -- 11-line proof that ends with Unit constructor!
   
   -- Paper 2 Main Result:
   theorem gap_equiv_WLPO : BidualGap ‚Üî WLPO := by
     constructor
     ¬∑ intro gap; cases gap; exact ‚ü®‚ü®()‚ü©‚ü©
     ¬∑ intro wlpo; cases wlpo; exact ‚ü®‚ü®()‚ü©‚ü©
   ```

3. **Unused Core Libraries**: While `src/Core/Analysis/*` and `src/Core/Cat/*` contain real definitions, the paper files don't use them

4. **Paper 1 Specific Issues**:
   - Main **Survey Theorem** uses `exact ‚ü®()‚ü©` after naming but not using PseudoFunctor machinery
   - Two flagship **Reflection lemmas** have single-line `by trivial` proofs
   - 12 total "cheap proofs" that compile only due to Unit tricks

## Required Actions

### Immediate (Phase 0)
1. **Update README**: Change badges to reflect true status
   - Paper 1: 75% formalized
   - Paper 2: 0% formalized (scaffold only)
   - Paper 3: 0% formalized (scaffold only)

2. **Replace all dummy structures with `sorry`**
   - This makes incomplete work visible
   - Prevents false "0 sorries" claims

### Paper 2 Missing Components
- `Analysis/WeakStar.lean` - Weak* topology on X**
- `Analysis/Goldstine.lean` - Goldstine theorem & density
- `Analysis/BidualIsometry.lean` - Canonical embedding isometry
- `Logic/WLPO.lean` - Formal WLPO ‚Üî gap equivalence
- `Analysis/QuantitativeGap.lean` - Œµ-gap estimates

### Paper 3 Missing Components
- `Cat/Bicategory/GPS.lean` - Gordon-Power-Street coherence
- `Cat/Found.lean` - 2-category of foundations
- `Cat/PseudoFunctor/OplaxLimit.lean` - Oplax limits
- `Cat/RhoHierarchy.lean` - Ordinal-valued metric
- `Cat/Obstruction.lean` - Functorial Obstruction Theorem

## No-Shortcuts Rules

### Golden Rules
1. **Only two acceptable states for any theorem:**
   - Work-in-progress: contains `sorry`
   - Finished: no `sorry` AND uses real mathematical definitions

2. **Forbidden patterns:**
   - Single-field structures with `Unit` or `True`
   - Defining `Prop` as `True`
   - Proofs using only `trivial`, `‚ü®()‚ü©`, or pattern matching on Unit
   - Hidden axioms outside `src/Extra/Axioms.lean`

3. **Every finished theorem must depend on non-trivial definitions** from the project or mathlib

## CI Enforcement Plan

Add these tools to prevent regression:

1. **Cheap Proofs Linter** (`lake exe cheap_proofs`)
   - Flags theorems whose proofs only use Init/Std/Unit/True

2. **Stub Structure Detector** (`scripts/check_struct_stubs.py`)
   - Catches `structure X where dummy : Unit` patterns

3. **Dependency Tracer** (`scripts/check_alignment.py`)
   - Verifies theorems use real mathematical libraries

## Estimated Effort

| Paper | Current State | Effort Required | External Help Needed |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Paper 1 | 75% complete | 2-3 weeks | Ordinal consultant (1 week) |
| Paper 2 | 0% (stubs only) | 4-6 weeks | Functional analyst (2 weeks), Constructive logic expert (1 week) |
| Paper 3 | <5% (stubs only) | 6-10 weeks | Category theorist (3 weeks), Proof theorist (2 weeks) |

## Work Brief Summary

### Phase 1: Paper 1 Cleanup (Weeks 1-3)
- Replace 12 "cheap" proofs
- Implement `OrdinalRho.lean`
- Complete Reflection lemmas

### Phase 2: Core Library Build (Weeks 1-6, parallel)
- Analysis branch: weak* topology, Goldstine, quantitative gap
- Category branch: GPS coherence, oplax limits, Found 2-category
- Logic branch: formal WLPO + constructive bridge

### Phase 3: Paper 2 Formalization (Weeks 4-8)
- Replace stubs with real definitions
- Implement bidual gap machinery
- Prove WLPO equivalence

### Phase 4: Paper 3 Build (Weeks 6-12)
- Implement full 2-categorical framework
- Prove Functorial Obstruction Theorem
- Complete œÅ-hierarchy estimates

## Critical Warning

**DO NOT:**
- Use `‚ü®()‚ü©` or pattern matching tricks instead of real proofs
- Define mathematical objects as Unit stubs
- Claim "0 sorries" until genuine formalization is complete
- Bypass CI checks with clever workarounds

**ALWAYS:**
- Use `sorry` for incomplete work
- Reference real mathematical definitions in proofs
- Keep PR's reviewable and well-documented
- Run alignment checks before claiming completion
