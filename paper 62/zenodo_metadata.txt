Description:
Paper 62 (merged with original Paper 63) of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics series.

MAIN RESULT: The sharp boundary between Markov's Principle (MP) and the Limited Principle of Omniscience (LPO) for decidability of Ext^1(Q(0), M) in the category of mixed motives is determined by a single invariant: the Hodge level l of the motive M.

- l <= 1 (e.g., elliptic curves, cubic threefolds): the intermediate Jacobian J^p is an abelian variety, the Northcott property transfers via the Abel-Jacobi isomorphism, and decidability requires at most MP.
- l >= 2 (e.g., quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds): J^p is a non-algebraic complex torus, the Northcott property fails structurally, and decidability escalates to LPO.

There is no intermediate condition ("weak Northcott") that prevents this escalation: each degree-d slice of the graded cycle space is BISH-decidable, but quantifying over all degrees requires LPO. The proof is an explicit constructive reduction.

Combined with Papers 59-61, the full Decidable Polarized Tannakian (DPT) hierarchy for mixed motives is governed by three invariants: analytic rank r, Hodge level l, and effective Lang constant c. As a consequence, cycle groups on Calabi-Yau threefolds — the compactification spaces of string theory — are structurally LPO, beyond any search procedure.

This paper merges the results of original Papers 62 (Northcott boundary) and 63 (intermediate Jacobian obstruction). Two Lean 4 formalization bundles are included: P62_NorthcottLPO (7 files, 954 lines) and P62_HodgeLevelBoundary (10 files, 1367 lines). Both compile with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 sorry.
