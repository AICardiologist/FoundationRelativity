=== TITLE ===
Newton vs. Lagrange vs. Hamilton: Constructive Stratification of Classical Mechanics (Paper 28, CRM Series)

=== AUTHORS ===

=== DESCRIPTION ===
Paper 28 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics (CRM) series. Lean 4 formalization proving that the three textbook formulations of classical mechanics -- Newtonian (equation of motion), Lagrangian (variational), and Hamiltonian (phase space) -- are constructively stratified: they require different logical principles.

For the discrete harmonic oscillator with N=2 time steps:

(1) BISH half: The Euler-Lagrange equation (8m-k)q = 4m(A+B) has a unique explicit solution. Proof is purely algebraic -- no Fan Theorem needed.

(2) Hamilton half (BISH): Hamilton's equations have a unique explicit solution. The discrete Legendre transform bridging Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations is an invertible BISH-level map.

(3) FT half: The assertion that every continuous function on [0,1] attains its minimum (and in particular that the action functional S has a minimizer) is equivalent to the Fan Theorem.

All equation-solving is BISH. All optimization is FT. The bridge between formulations is BISH.

Formalized in Lean 4 with Mathlib (621 lines, 6 source files, zero sorry, zero custom axioms). Includes LaTeX companion paper (17 pages).
