Description:
Paper 64 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics series.

MAIN RESULT: The p-adic precision bound N_M = v_p(#E(F_p)) for crystalline decidability of elliptic curves E/Q satisfies N_M <= 2 for all (E, p), with N_M = 2 only possible at p = 2, and N_M <= 1 for every p >= 3. For p >= 5, equality N_M = 1 holds if and only if E is anomalous at p (a_p = 1). The proof is a short argument from the Hasse bound |a_p| <= 2*sqrt(p).

The principal consequence is that p-adic crystalline decidability for elliptic curves requires at most two digits of p-adic precision at p = 2 and at most one digit everywhere else. The p-adic side of the decidability problem is thus uniformly trivial, contrasting sharply with the Archimedean side, where rank creates genuine stratification (Papers 59, 61). This asymmetry -- p-adic uniform, Archimedean stratified -- is a clean structural result within the Decidable Polarized Tannakian (DPT) framework.

Computational verification: 1,812 elliptic curves across 15 primes, covering 23,454 (E, p) pairs. Zero exceptions. N_M does not correlate with rank, torsion structure, or CM status.

Package contains: LaTeX source and PDF (10 pages), self-contained Python computation script, all generated CSV/JSON data files, computation report, and 6 PNG plots.
