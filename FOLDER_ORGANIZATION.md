# Repository Folder Organization

**Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Context**: Repository cleanup to focus on active Papers development

## ‚úÖ ACTIVE FOLDERS (Kept in Root)

### **Essential for Current Development:**
- **`Papers/`** - Main academic results (Papers 1-4)
- **`archive/bicategorical/`** - **CRITICAL for Paper 3** 
  - `BicatFound.lean` - Foundation 2-category implementation
  - `PseudoNatTrans.lean` - Pseudo-natural transformations
  - Direct implementation of Paper 3's bicategorical framework
- **`docs/`** - Active documentation (planning, reference, development)
- **`scripts/`** - Essential build/CI scripts (cleaned)

### **Core Repository Files:**
- `README.md`, `lakefile.lean`, `lake-manifest.json`, `lean-toolchain`
- `Papers.lean`, `LICENSE`, `CITATION.cff` 
- `HOW_TO_CITE.md`, `ZENODO_METADATA.md` (Paper 2 artifacts)
- `SORRY_ALLOWLIST.txt` (CI configuration)

## üóÇÔ∏è MOVED TO old_files/ (Historical/Legacy)

### **Legacy Module Files:**
- `old_files/root_level_modules/` - All the moved root-level `.lean` files
  - `CategoryTheory/`, `Found/`, `Gap2/`, `Logic/`, `RNPFunctor/`, etc.
  - These were preliminary implementations superseded by `Papers/P3_2CatFramework/`

### **Historical Documentation:**
- `old_files/legacy_docs/` - Outdated project documentation
- `old_files/docs_archive/` - Historical development logs and sprint reports

### **Development Artifacts:**
- `old_files/historical_tests/` - Legacy test files for old pathologies
- `old_files/scratch_files/` - Temporary test files and compilation scripts
- `old_files/historical_scripts/` - Debugging and analysis scripts

## üéØ Paper 3 Relevance Analysis

**Paper 3: "Foundation-Relativity as Non-Uniformizability"** is about:
- 2-category of foundations (`Found`) with interpretations
- Uniformizability and height invariants  
- Bicategorical framework for pseudo-functors
- Stone window as case study

### **Critical Finding**: 
The `archive/bicategorical/` folder contains the **actual Lean implementation** of Paper 3's framework:
- Foundation bicategory with associators, unitors, coherence
- Pseudo-natural transformations between pseudo-functors  
- Whiskering operations and pentagon/triangle coherence laws
- Infrastructure for Paper 3's uniformizability theorems

This folder was **preserved** as it's essential for Paper 3 formalization.

## üìä Space Savings

- **Moved**: ~100 files including large module hierarchies and historical logs
- **Repository focus**: Now clearly centered on active `Papers/` development
- **Maintained**: Full git history through proper `git mv` operations

## üîß Impact on Development

- **Paper 1**: No impact - all files in `Papers/P1_GBC/`
- **Paper 2**: No impact - all files in `Papers/P2_BidualGap/`  
- **Paper 3**: **Enhanced** - `archive/bicategorical/` preserved and identified as key infrastructure
- **Paper 4**: No impact - all files in `Papers/P4_SpectralGeometry/`
- **Build system**: Maintained with essential scripts kept in `scripts/`

Repository is now clean, organized, and ready for continued Paper development.
