# Hilbert Space Setup for Spectral Gap

This module imports ℓ² machinery from mathlib4 and sets up the basic infrastructure
for spectral gap analysis on compact self-adjoint operators.

Milestone A implementation - ℓ² machinery and spectral theory foundations.
-/

-- Mathlib imports will be added here for ℓ² spaces, compact operators, and spectral theory
