DESCRIPTION:
Paper 42 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics (CRM) of Mathematical Physics series. This paper applies the axiom calibration framework to the cosmological constant problem -- the alleged 10^120 discrepancy between quantum field theory's "prediction" of vacuum energy and the observed value. The problem decomposes into three logically distinct claims with different constructive status.

Claim I (Dissolved): The 10^120 ultraviolet discrepancy is a regulator-dependent artifact. The unregularized vacuum energy does not converge to a real number at any level of the constructive hierarchy. Different regularization schemes (cutoff, dimensional, zeta-function) produce different finite values. A regulator-dependent quantity has no empirical content within the framework. The CRM analysis provides a formal, machine-checked expression of the post-naturalness position articulated by Martin (2012), Bianchi-Rovelli (2010), and Hossenfelder (2019): the 10^120 is a property of a calculational choice, not of quantum field theory.

Claim II (Reclassified): The "naturalness" argument is a Bayesian prior, not a mathematical derivation. The Hollands-Wald axioms prove that the cosmological constant is a free parameter of the renormalized theory. Naturalness resides outside the BISH/LPO deductive hierarchy.

Claim III (Identified, LPO): The genuine constraint is the 55-decimal-place cancellation between the bare cosmological constant and the electroweak/QCD vacuum condensates. Computing the exact interacting condensates requires the thermodynamic limit (Fekete's subadditive lemma, Paper 29), showing that LPO suffices for the fine-tuning equation. The residual fine-tuning is an LPO equality -- logically mundane, at the same level as every thermodynamic limit in physics.

The Casimir effect proves the scaffolding diagnostic works: energy differences are BISH-computable and experimentally verified; absolute vacuum energies are regulator-dependent and physically meaningless.

Main formalized results:
- vacuum_energy_divergent: Unregularized vacuum energy is unbounded (BISH)
- prediction_regulator_dependent: Two valid schemes yield different values (BISH)
- lambda_free_parameter: Wald ambiguity -- Lambda is a free parameter (BISH)
- casimir_bish: Casimir energy difference has computable Cauchy modulus (BISH)
- condensate_lpo: Exact interacting condensate exists given LPO (LPO)
- rg_running_bish: Perturbative RG running via Picard-Lindelof (BISH)
- fine_tuning_lpo: Fine-tuning equation holds given LPO (LPO)
- cc_calibration: 7-part assembly theorem (BISH + LPO)
- cc_master: Master theorem with full axiom audit
