TITLE:
Beyond LPO: The Thermodynamic Stratification of Physical Undecidability (Paper 39, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

DESCRIPTION:
Paper 39 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics of Mathematical Physics series. While Papers 36-38 showed all known physical undecidabilities are LPO (Sigma-1-zero), this paper proves the ceiling is not Sigma-1-zero. A modified Cubitt encoding --- running a Turing machine on all inputs simultaneously via Robinson tiling with perimeter counters --- encodes the Sigma-2-zero-complete Finiteness Problem. The generic spectral gap (without promise gap) is Sigma-2-zero/Pi-2-zero-complete, requiring LPO-prime (the Turing jump of LPO). The central result is the Thermodynamic Stratification Theorem: computational complexity bifurcates on thermodynamic scaling. Extensive observables (energy density, magnetization) cap at LPO via Fekete's subadditive lemma, while intensive observables (spectral gap) reach LPO-prime. Crucially, empirical physics --- which operates at finite precision and therefore measures extensive quantities --- remains capped at LPO. Promise-gapped physics (all of Papers 36-38) also caps at LPO. All results formalized in Lean 4 over Mathlib with zero sorry. The formalization comprises 8 Lean source files.
