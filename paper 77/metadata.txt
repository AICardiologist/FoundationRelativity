Abstract:
The Hodge Conjecture for products of CM elliptic curves was proved by Lieberman (1968) and subsumed by Deligne (1982). The mathematical content of this paper is a known consequence of these results and is not novel. The contribution is methodological.

We produce explicit Hodge decompositions for E^4 (E a CM elliptic curve with End(E) tensor Q = Q(i)): all 36 Hodge (2,2) basis vectors expressed as Q-linear combinations of cup products of divisor classes, formally verified in Lean 4 by native_decide. We also verify that E^4 supports no exotic Weil classes (dim Hodge = dim div. products = 36).

These results are produced by the CRMLint Squeeze, a protocol for reverse-engineering classical proofs into constructive ones, demonstrated on a case where the answer is independently known. The paper introduces asymmetric offloading (Python CAS computes exact Q-algebra, Lean kernel verifies) and documents the engineering: the noncomputable trap, token overflow, and sparse encoding. The Lean bundle builds with 0 sorry, 0 user-declared axiom in the constructive path, and 0 noncomputable.
