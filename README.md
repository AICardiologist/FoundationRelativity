**75 papers. ~89,000 lines Lean 4. One finding:**

**The logical cost of mathematics is the logical cost of the real numbers.**

Every non-constructive principle required by any physical theory or arithmetic theorem enters through one place: the real number line. Remove ℝ and everything collapses to Bishop-style constructive mathematics (BISH), where every object is computable and every proof carries an algorithm.

## The Logical Hierarchy

```
BISH  ⊂  BISH + MP  ⊂  BISH + LLPO  ⊂  BISH + WLPO  ⊂  BISH + LPO  ⊂  CLASS
```

| Principle | What it decides |
|-----------|----------------|
| **BISH** | Nothing — every existential witness is computed, every disjunction is decided by the proof |
| **MP** (Markov) | ¬¬∃ → ∃ for decidable predicates: if an unbounded search cannot fail, it succeeds |
| **LLPO** | For every real x: x ≤ 0 or x ≥ 0 (sign is decidable) |
| **WLPO** | For every real x: x = 0 or x ≠ 0 (equality to zero is decidable) |
| **LPO** | For every binary sequence: it is identically zero or it contains a 1 (omniscience) |

Two independent principles — the **Fan Theorem** (FT, every bar is uniform: compact spaces behave classically) and **Dependent Choice** (DC, sequential choices along a total relation) — sit outside this chain.

---

## Part One: Physics (Papers 2–44)

### The finding

**BISH + LPO is the complete logical constitution of empirically accessible physics.** Forty-three papers audit the logical content of quantum mechanics, general relativity, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, quantum information, the Standard Model, AdS/CFT, and cosmology. Every empirical prediction lands at or below BISH + LPO. Classical logic is never needed.

LPO enters through exactly one door: the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators on L²(ℝⁿ). That is the sole non-constructive ingredient in all of physics.

### What is surprising

**The ceiling is uniform.** You might expect different physical theories to scatter across the hierarchy — QM at one level, GR at another, QFT somewhere else. They don't. They all hit the same ceiling. The logical constitution of the Standard Model is the logical constitution of the 1D Ising model.

**The cost is genuine.** Fekete's Subadditive Lemma — the workhorse behind thermodynamic limits, free energy convergence, and phase-transition arguments — is *equivalent* to LPO (Paper 29). You cannot eliminate the non-constructive cost. It is not an artefact of a particular proof strategy.

**FT and DC are dispensable.** The Fan Theorem (compact optimisation, action minimisers) and Dependent Choice (ergodic theorems, strong law of large numbers) are logically independent of the omniscience spine. Both are physically dispensable: every empirical prediction they yield is recoverable in BISH + LPO (Papers 30–31). The variational formulation of mechanics is logically unnecessary for any prediction.

**The Landau pole is BISH.** QED's Landau pole — naively the most "non-constructive" object in renormalisation — is fully constructive. The closed-form solution provides an explicit Cauchy modulus. No omniscience required (Paper 32).

**Confinement is free.** QCD confinement (mass gap, WLPO) is subsidised by the LPO already paid for the continuum limit. Once you pay for the thermodynamic limit, confinement adds zero logical cost (Paper 33).

**All undecidability is LPO.** Cubitt's spectral gap undecidability, phase diagram uncomputability, 1D spectral gaps, uncomputable RG flows — every quantum undecidability result traces back to Wang tiling, which is LPO. Quantum undecidability introduces nothing beyond thermodynamic limits (Papers 36–38).

**The measurement problem dissolves.** Copenhagen (WLPO), Many-Worlds (DC), Bohmian mechanics (LPO) sit at provably distinct positions in the hierarchy. The "measurement problem" is not one problem but three logically incompatible commitments (Paper 44).

## Part Two: Arithmetic Geometry (Papers 45–75)

### The finding

The same framework that classifies physics classifies arithmetic geometry. Five major conjectures (Hodge, Tate, BSD, Fontaine–Mazur, Weight-Monodromy) each exhibit a *de-omniscientising descent*: geometric origin converts LPO-dependent claims to BISH-decidable ones. The residual that survives is Markov's Principle — the cost of unbounded search.

### The Decidable Polarized Tannakian (DPT) framework (Paper 50)

Three axioms distil Grothendieck's category of numerical motives:
1. **Decidable morphisms** (Standard Conjecture D)
2. **Algebraic spectrum** (eigenvalues in Q̄)
3. **Archimedean polarisation** (positive-definite bilinear form)

These three axioms are exactly what de-omniscientisation requires. They are also exactly what the Archimedean place provides: u(ℝ) = ∞ guarantees positive-definite forms in every dimension. At every finite prime p, u(ℚₚ) = 4 blocks this in dimension ≥ 5.

### Three-invariant hierarchy (Papers 59–63)

Three numbers classify the logical cost of cycle-search for any motive:
- **Rank r**: analytic rank of the L-function. r = 0 or 1 → BISH. r ≥ 2 → MP (Minkowski forces unbounded search).
- **Hodge level ℓ**: ℓ ≤ 1 → intermediate Jacobian is algebraic → Northcott bounds search → MP. ℓ ≥ 2 → non-algebraic complex torus → LPO.
- **Lang constant c**: effective height lower bound converts MP to BISH by bounding the search.

### The h = f identity (Papers 56–58, 65–66)

A new arithmetic identity, not a CRM classification: the Faltings height times the norm of the Steinitz class equals the conductor on CM abelian fourfolds. Verified on 1,220 pairs with zero exceptions.

### The trilogy (Papers 68–70) — confirmation, not surprise

**Paper 68: FLT is BISH.** The Wiles path costs BISH + WLPO (weight-1 obstruction). Kisin's 2009 bypass avoids it. Net cost: BISH. This confirms the DPT prediction that major arithmetic theorems are cheaper than they look.

**Paper 69: Function field Langlands is BISH.** Predicted by the absence of an Archimedean place. The one genuine discovery: the CRM boundary is algebraic-vs-transcendental spectral parameters, not discrete-vs-continuous spectrum.

**Paper 70: The Archimedean Principle.** Synthesis, not discovery. Names the mechanism (u(ℝ) = ∞), formalises the projection-vs-search gap, explains why physics and Langlands share an architecture.

**Paper 71: Applications.** Lattice cryptography is Archimedean-hard; SVP phase transition sits at the projection/search boundary.

## What Connects the Two Halves

The mechanism is **u(ℝ) = ∞**: positive-definite quadratic forms exist over ℝ in every dimension. Three fields independently exploit this via the same architecture:

| Field | Inner-product structure | How it uses u(ℝ) = ∞ |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Physics | Hilbert space ⟨ψ,φ⟩ | Spectral theorem → measurement → projection |
| Arithmetic geometry | Rosati involution on abelian varieties | Néron–Tate height → bounded search |
| Automorphic theory | Petersson inner product | Trace formula → spectral decomposition |

Physics descends by *projection* (→ BISH). Arithmetic descends by *search* (→ BISH + MP). The gap is exactly Markov's Principle. That is why number theory is harder than physics.

## What Is Genuinely New

| Old (known before this programme) | New (established here) |
|---|---|
| ℝ is logically hard (Brouwer 1907, Bishop 1967) | Uniform calibration across physics AND arithmetic in one framework |
| Constructive mathematics avoids LEM | u(ℝ) = ∞ identified as the *specific mechanism* forcing positive-definite descent |
| Physics is "more constructive" than pure math (folk intuition) | Projection vs. search as precise explanation, with the gap being exactly MP |
| Langlands programme connects automorphic forms and Galois representations | Physics-Langlands connections explained as shared logical constraint from ℝ |
| Individual constructive proofs exist for individual theorems | Systematic classification of 70 theorems revealing a single architectural pattern |
