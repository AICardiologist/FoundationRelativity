## 🎯 Overview

A Lean 4 formalization exploring how mathematical pathologies behave differently under various foundational assumptions. This project demonstrates **foundation-relativity**: certain mathematical constructions that work in classical mathematics (ZFC) become impossible in constructive settings (BISH).

### Key Results

The project formalizes four major results:

1. **Gödel-Banach Correspondence** (Paper 1) ✅ - Rank-one operators encoding Gödel's incompleteness
2. **Bidual Gap Construction** (Paper 2) ✅ - Constructive real multiplication complete!  
3. **2-Categorical Framework** (Paper 3) 📋 - Foundation-relative pseudo-functors
4. **Spectral Geometry** (Paper 4) 🔧 - Undecidable eigenvalues on manifolds

### Foundation-Relativity Hierarchy

Each pathology has a **relativity degree** ρ indicating logical strength:
- **ρ = 1**: Requires WLPO (Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience)
- **ρ = 2**: Requires DC_ω (Countable Choice)
- **ρ = 3**: Requires AC_ω (Choice for countable families)

## 🔬 Mathematical Significance

This project demonstrates:

1. **Formal Verification Insights**: Machine-checked proofs revealed mathematical errors in informal arguments
2. **Foundation-Relativity**: Precise characterization of when constructions work/fail
3. **Axiomatization Strategy**: Sometimes axiomatizing deep results is better than full formalization
4. **AI-Assisted Mathematics**: Collaborative development with Math-AI systems
