# Paper 5: [Title TBD]

## Status: Development Starting

**Development Start**: September 2025  
**Current Phase**: Planning and initial development

## Overview

Paper 5 represents a new direction in the Axiom Calibration (AxCal) framework, building on the complete foundational work from Papers 1-4:

- **Paper 1**: Rank-One Toggle Kernel (core complete, 4 sorries) ❄️ `paper1-freeze-v1.0`
- **Paper 2**: WLPO ↔ Bidual Gap (main theorem complete, 3 conditional sorries) ❄️ `paper2-freeze-v1.0`  
- **Paper 3A**: AxCal Framework (complete, 0 sorries) ❄️ `paper3a-freeze-v1.0`
- **Paper 3B**: Proof-Theoretic Scaffold (complete, 21 axioms) ❄️ `paper3b-freeze-v1.0`
- **Paper 4**: Quantum Spectra AxCal (complete, 0 sorries, Zenodo archived) ❄️ `paper4-freeze-v1.0`

## Inherited Infrastructure

Paper 5 has access to the complete AxCal framework:

### From Paper 3A (AxCal Framework)
- Three orthogonal axes: WLPO, FT, DCω
- Uniformization height theory
- Stone Window API with 100+ Boolean algebra lemmas
- Complete 2-categorical foundation structure

### From Paper 3B (Proof Theory)  
- Stage-based ladder system
- 21 axioms representing proof-theoretic limits
- RFN_Σ₁ → Con schematic proof
- Collision theory framework

### From Paper 4 (Quantum Applications)
- S0-S4 spectral calibrations
- Profile algebra and composition laws
- Markov's Principle (MP) integration
- Advanced certificate system

## Development Goals

[To be defined based on research direction]

## Build Commands

```bash
# Paper 5 development target (when implemented)
lake build Papers.P5_NewDirection.Main

# Inherited infrastructure available
lake build Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3A_Main  # AxCal framework

## Connection to Previous Work

Paper 5 leverages the complete AxCal ecosystem:
- **Calibration methodology** from Papers 3A/3B
- **Operational examples** from Papers 1, 2, 4
- **Proof-theoretic boundaries** established in 3B
- **Implementation patterns** proven in 4

The frozen state of Papers 1-4 provides a stable foundation for new research directions.
