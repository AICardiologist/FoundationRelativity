# QA Audit Findings - Papers 1, 2 & 3 Formalization Status

**Date:** 2025-08-03  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

## Summary

QA audit has revealed that **ALL THREE PAPERS have significant formalization issues** despite claims of "0 sorries".

### The Problem

The Lean files use Unit tricks and trivial proofs instead of real mathematics:

**Paper 1 Example - Main Survey Theorem:**
```lean
theorem survey_theorem : ... := by
  -- 11 lines that import PseudoFunctor but never use it
  exact ⟨()⟩  -- Ends with Unit constructor!
```

**Paper 2 Example - Main Result:**
```lean
structure BidualGap where
  dummy : Unit

theorem gap_equiv_WLPO : BidualGap ↔ WLPO := by
  constructor
  · intro gap; cases gap; exact ⟨⟨()⟩⟩
  · intro wlpo; cases wlpo; exact ⟨⟨()⟩⟩
```

**Paper 3 Example - Everything is stubs:**
```lean
structure CategoricalObstruction where dummy : Unit
structure TwoCatPseudoFunctor where dummy : Unit
-- All "proofs" are by trivial or exact ⟨()⟩
```

This compiles with "0 sorries" but proves nothing about the actual mathematics.

### What Should Be There

Paper 1 should contain:
- Real proof of Survey Theorem using bicategory machinery
- Proper Reflection lemmas (Set↔Type, CZF↔HoTT)
- Ordinal-valued 2-functor ρ implementation

Paper 2 should contain:
- Formal definition of bidual spaces X**
- Canonical embedding ι : X → X**
- Goldstine's theorem
- Quantitative gap estimates
- WLPO equivalence with real functional analysis

Paper 3 should contain:
- Full bicategory of foundations
- Gordon-Power-Street coherence
- Pseudo-functors and transformations
- ρ-hierarchy with ordinal arithmetic
- Functorial Obstruction Theorem

### Current Reality

- Paper 1: ~75% genuinely formalized but **main theorem is fake** (12 "cheap" proofs)
- Paper 2: 0% formalized (only stubs)
- Paper 3: <5% formalized (only stubs)

## Required Actions

1. **Replace all dummy structures with `sorry`** to make incomplete work visible
2. **Implement real mathematical definitions** from the LaTeX papers
3. **Write genuine proofs** using the core libraries in `src/Core/*`
4. **Add CI checks** to prevent Unit-stub tricks

See [CRITICAL_QA_NOTICE.md](/CRITICAL_QA_NOTICE.md) for full details and work plan.

## No-Shortcuts Rule

**Golden Rule**: A theorem has only two acceptable states:
- Contains `sorry` (work in progress)
- Has a real proof using mathematical definitions (complete)

Using `⟨()⟩` or Unit stubs to get "0 sorries" is forbidden.
