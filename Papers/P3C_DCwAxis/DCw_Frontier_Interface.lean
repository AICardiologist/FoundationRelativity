  Paper 3C: DCω → Baire — interface (no sorries, no theorems).
  This file just defines tokens and target statements you will prove in 3C.
  
  Note: We define a simplified Baire property here without importing mathlib topology,
  to keep the build lightweight. The full formalization would use mathlib's BaireSpace.

Simplified Baire property for ℕ^ℕ: 
Every countable family of dense open sets has dense intersection.
For now, we use a placeholder definition.

  -- For now, we define it as a token that we'll prove from DCω
