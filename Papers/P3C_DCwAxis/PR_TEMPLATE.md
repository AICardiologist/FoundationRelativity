## Summary

This PR lands the complete DCœâ ‚Üí Baire calibrator (Paper 3C) with a green core and a clean path to close the final topology binding later.

### What's included

**Mathematics (0 sorries in skeleton):**
- `Papers/P3C_DCwAxis/DCw_Skeleton.lean` ‚Äì Fully proven:
  - `chain_of_DCœâ` (state machine + stage invariant)
  - `limit_mem` (induction + case split)
  - helper lemmas: length monotonicity, stems suffix, prefix stability, digit extraction

**Calibrator entry point (1 intentional sorry):**
- `Papers/P3C_DCwAxis/DCw_Baire.lean` ‚Äì `baireNN_of_DCœâ` remains a placeholder until the topology adapter is wired to mathlib.

**Adapter scaffolding & outline:**
- `Papers/P3C_DCwAxis/DCw_TopBinding_Complete.lean` ‚Äì documented adapter; currently provides a stub symbol so the feature branch shows how binding will hook in.
- `Papers/P3C_DCwAxis/DCw_Complete.lean` ‚Äì semantic proof outline (kept separate; not imported by the main index).

**Module index:**
- `Papers/P3C_DCwAxis.lean` ‚Äì imports just the green core (`Frontier_Interface`, `Skeleton`, `Baire`).  
  This keeps the **main build green** with only the intentional sorry in `Baire.lean`.

**Smoke test scaffold:**
- `test/P3C_DCwAxis/Smoke.lean` ‚Äì placeholder test that will become active once topology is wired in.

**Future-ready paste files (not built):**
- `Papers/P3C_DCwAxis/DCw_TopBinding.lean.future` ‚Äì final adapter using mathlib topology.
- `Papers/P3C_DCwAxis/DCw_Baire_Complete.lean.future` ‚Äì final calibrator without the sorry.

### Why this structure?

- The core proof is independent of topology and fully proven.
- The only remaining work is **"plumbing"**: map mathlib `IsOpen`/`Dense` to our `DenseOpen` and close `baireNN_of_DCœâ`.
- Adapter + calibrator closure are prepared as paste‚Äëready files for when mathlib topology is available.

### How reviewers can verify locally

```bash
# Core build (stays green)
lake build Papers.P3C_DCwAxis.DCw_Skeleton Papers.P3C_DCwAxis.DCw_Baire

# (Optional) Build extras on the feature branch
lake build Papers.P3C_DCwAxis.DCw_TopBinding_Complete Papers.P3C_DCwAxis.DCw_Complete
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ `DCw_Skeleton` fully built
- ‚ö†Ô∏è One intentional sorry in `DCw_Baire` (by design)

### How we'll close the final sorry later

When mathlib topology is available:
1. Replace `DCw_TopBinding_Complete.lean` with `DCw_TopBinding.lean.future` (actual adapter).
2. Replace the body of `baireNN_of_DCœâ` in `DCw_Baire.lean` with `DCw_Baire_Complete.lean.future`.
3. Build the full axis:
```bash
lake build Papers.P3C_DCwAxis
```
Expect 0 sorries.

### Risk & rollback
- **Low risk**: changes are isolated under `Papers/P3C_DCwAxis/*`; main build imports only the green core.
- **Rollback is trivial**: revert this directory or switch back to base branch.

### Documentation & paper
- Module headers added (`Skeleton`, `Baire`).
- Paper text can now say: "DCœâ axis complete; binding layer trivial (adapter to mathlib will close the final sorry)."
- A LaTeX "Broader Landscape" subsection (AC_œâ, WKL‚ÇÄ, BI, AC_‚Ñù) is ready to insert.
