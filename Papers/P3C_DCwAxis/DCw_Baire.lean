  Paper 3C: DCω → Baire (skeleton).
  This file will eventually prove the main statement; for now we keep a stub theorem (or axioms)
  *outside CI* so 3A stays clean.

  -- TODO(3C): replace with the real proof
  -- You can temporarily put `admit`/`sorry` here in 3C, since 3C is outside 3A CI.
  -- For now, keep a placeholder so the file compiles:
  intro h_dcω
  -- The real proof would use DC_ω to construct sequences in ℕ^ℕ
  -- that witness density of intersections
  intro P h_all
  exact h_all 0
