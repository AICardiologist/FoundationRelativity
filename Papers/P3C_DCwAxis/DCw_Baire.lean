# Paper 3C: Main Calibrator Theorem

DCω implies BaireNN (intentional sorry until topology binding).

/-- Main calibrator theorem: `DCω ⇒ BaireNN`. -/
theorem baireNN_of_DCω : BaireFromDCωStatement := by
  intro hDC
  -- The BaireNN token represents: "Every countable family of dense opens has nonempty intersection"
  -- We prove this constructively using DCω to build a witness point
  
  -- Given a countable family of dense open sets, we need to find x in their intersection
  -- This will be completed when BaireNN is bound to the actual Baire property
  
  -- Outline of the complete proof:
  -- 1. Given U : Nat → Set Seq with each U n dense and open
  -- 2. Convert to DenseOpen via DenseOpen.ofDenseOpen
  -- 3. Apply chain_of_DCω starting from empty cylinder
  -- 4. Take x := limit_of_chain
  -- 5. Use limit_mem to show x ∈ every U n
  
  -- For now, this remains abstract until BaireNN gets its semantic binding
