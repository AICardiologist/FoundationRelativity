# Paper 3C: Topology → DenseOpen Adapter

Bridge from mathlib topology to cylinder-based DenseOpen interface.

## The main adapter (to be completed with topology)

When mathlib topology is available, we would define:

```lean
def DenseOpen.ofDenseOpen (U : Set Seq) (hU : IsOpen U) (hDense : Dense U) : DenseOpen where
  hit C := ∃ x : Seq, C.mem x ∧ x ∈ U
  
  dense C := by
    -- Take C' = C (no refinement needed)
    use C, Nat.le_refl _
    -- Density guarantees a hit
    exact cyl_hits_dense_open hU hDense C
  
  refine1 C := by
    -- Pick any point in C ∩ U
    rcases cyl_hits_dense_open hU hDense C with ⟨x, hxC, hxU⟩
    -- Extend by x's next digit
    let a := x C.stem.length
    use a
    -- Show the extension hits U
    use x
    constructor
    · exact mem_extend_of_mem hxC rfl
    · exact hxU
```

This would rely on:
- `isOpen_cyl`: Cylinders are open in the product topology
- `cyl_nonempty`: Every cylinder is nonempty
- `cyl_hits_dense_open`: Dense open sets hit every cylinder
- `mem_extend_of_mem`: Extension preserves membership

-- For now, we provide a stub that can be used in DCw_Complete
axiom DenseOpen.ofDenseOpen : ∀ (_ : Seq → Prop), DenseOpen
