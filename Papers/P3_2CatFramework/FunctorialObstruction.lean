/-! ### Functorial Obstruction Theorem -/

/--
Main obstruction theorem: There is no pseudo-functor that simultaneously
preserves the bicategorical structure and eliminates witness groupoid
pathologies.

This gives us the first substantial theorem that quantifies over 2‑cells
and needs the full associator/unitor theorems from Day 2 SWE-AI work.

  sorry -- TODO: Implement using pentagon/triangle coherence and witness groupoid theory

/-! ### Supporting Results -/

/--
2-cell quantification lemma: The obstruction manifests at the 2-cell level.
This demonstrates why strict 2-categories are insufficient.
-/
lemma obstruction_at_twocells :
  ∀ (F G : Foundation) (_α _β : Interp F G),
  ∃ (_witness_2cell : Unit), True := by
  sorry -- TODO: Implement proper 2-cell analysis showing non-functoriality

/--
Pentagon dependency: The obstruction proof requires pentagon coherence.
This creates the dependency on SWE-AI's Day 2 associator work.

lemma pentagon_required_for_obstruction :
  (∃ (_pentagon : Unit), True) → 
  ¬ ∃ (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor), preservesPentagon F ∧ eliminatesWitnesses F := by
  sorry -- TODO: Implement using pentagon coherence axioms

/--
Witness groupoid connection: The obstruction is witnessed by 
concrete pathological objects from the witness groupoid.

lemma witness_groupoid_realizes_obstruction :
  ∃ (F : Foundation) (w : GenericWitness F), True := by
  sorry -- TODO: Construct concrete witness from groupoid theory
