/-! ### Functorial Obstruction Theorem -/

/--
Main obstruction theorem: There is no pseudo-functor that simultaneously
preserves the bicategorical structure and eliminates witness groupoid
pathologies.

This gives us the first substantial theorem that quantifies over 2‑cells
and needs the full associator/unitor theorems from Day 2 SWE-AI work.

  -- FIXME(junior‑prof, 2025‑08‑07):
  -- * This declaration currently uses a dummy witness.
  -- * It must be replaced by a genuine proof once universe
  --   constraints are solved (see issue Paper3-Blocker-U3).
  sorry -- TODO: Implement using pentagon/triangle coherence and witness groupoid theory
  -- Key idea: Witnesses exist in BISH but F would eliminate them, contradiction

/-! ### Supporting Results -/

/--
2-cell quantification lemma: The obstruction manifests at the 2-cell level.
This demonstrates why strict 2-categories are insufficient.

lemma obstruction_at_twocells :
  ∀ (F G : Foundation) (α β : Interp F G),
  ∃ (witness_2cell : Unit), True := by
  -- FIXME(junior‑prof, 2025‑08‑07):
  -- * This declaration currently uses a dummy witness.
  -- * It must be replaced by a genuine proof once universe
  --   constraints are solved (see issue Paper3-Blocker-U4).
  sorry -- TODO: Implement proper 2-cell analysis showing non-functoriality
  -- Need to construct actual 2-cells witnessing the obstruction

/--
Pentagon dependency: The obstruction proof requires pentagon coherence.
This creates the dependency on SWE-AI's Day 2 associator work.

lemma pentagon_required_for_obstruction :
  (∃ (pentagon : Unit), True) → 
  ¬ ∃ (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor), preservesPentagon F ∧ eliminatesWitnesses F := by
  -- FIXME(junior‑prof, 2025‑08‑07):
  -- * This declaration currently uses a dummy witness.
  -- * It must be replaced by a genuine proof once universe
  --   constraints are solved (see issue Paper3-Blocker-U5).
  sorry -- TODO: Implement using pentagon coherence axioms
  -- Show that pentagon coherence is essential for the obstruction

/--
Witness groupoid connection: The obstruction is witnessed by 
concrete pathological objects from the witness groupoid.

  -- * It must be replaced by a genuine proof once universe

  sorry -- TODO: Construct concrete witness from groupoid theory
