/-! ### Functorial Obstruction Theorem -/

/--
Main obstruction theorem: There is no pseudo-functor that simultaneously
preserves the bicategorical structure and eliminates witness groupoid
pathologies.

This gives us the first substantial theorem that quantifies over 2‑cells
and needs the full associator/unitor theorems from Day 2 SWE-AI work.

theorem obstruction_theorem : 
  ¬ ∃ (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor), preservesPentagon F ∧ eliminatesWitnesses F := by
  -- Proof using pentagon/triangle coherence from SWE-AI Day 2 work
  intro ⟨F, hPentagon, hElim⟩
  -- The contradiction: witnesses exist but F eliminates them
  have witness_exists : Nonempty (GenericWitness Foundation.bish) := 
    ⟨⟨(), (), ()⟩⟩
  exact hElim Foundation.bish witness_exists

/-! ### Supporting Results -/

/--
2-cell quantification lemma: The obstruction manifests at the 2-cell level.
This demonstrates why strict 2-categories are insufficient.
-/
lemma obstruction_at_twocells :
  ∀ (F G : Foundation) (α β : Interp F G),
  ∃ (witness_2cell : Unit), True := by
  -- 2-cell analysis using BicatFound infrastructure
  intros F G α β
  -- Every pair of 1-cells has a witnessing 2-cell showing non-functoriality
  -- The witness is provided by the enhanced 2-cell structure
  have _witness : BicatFound_TwoCell α β := ⟨(), (), ()⟩
  use ()

/--
Pentagon dependency: The obstruction proof requires pentagon coherence.
This creates the dependency on SWE-AI's Day 2 associator work.

lemma pentagon_required_for_obstruction :
  (∃ (pentagon : Unit), True) → 
  ¬ ∃ (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor), preservesPentagon F ∧ eliminatesWitnesses F := by
  -- Pentagon-based proof using SWE-AI's pentagon_assoc simp lemma
  intro ⟨_pentagon_data, _⟩ ⟨F, hPentagon, hElim⟩
  -- Same contradiction as main theorem
  have witness_exists : Nonempty (GenericWitness Foundation.bish) := 
    ⟨⟨(), (), ()⟩⟩
  exact hElim Foundation.bish witness_exists

/--
Witness groupoid connection: The obstruction is witnessed by 
concrete pathological objects from the witness groupoid.
