## ✅ Phase 1-2 Achievements - Corresponding to Paper 3 LaTeX

### ✅ Phase 1: Complete Bicategorical Foundation (Phase1_Simple.lean)
1. **✅ Foundation 2-category**: Objects (foundations), 1-morphisms (interpretations), 2-morphisms  
2. **✅ Σ₀ pinned signature**: Standard interpretation with ℕ, Bool, ℝ, ℓ∞, c₀, quotient
3. **✅ Banach preservation**: Interpretations preserve finite/countable limits, completions, compactness
4. **✅ Coherence laws**: Pentagon and triangle identities for associators/unitors
5. **✅ Example foundations**: BISH, BISH+WLPO with concrete inclusion map

### ✅ Phase 2: Uniformization Height Theory (Phase2_UniformHeight.lean)
1. **✅ Witness families**: WitnessFamily structure on Σ₀ objects
2. **✅ UniformizableOn**: Structure for uniformization at foundation levels
3. **✅ GapFamily**: Bidual gap witness family reflecting WLPO bit at ℓ∞
4. **✅ Height = 1 theorem**: `gap_height_eq_one` proving no uniformization at level 0, uniformization at level 1
5. **✅ Technical robustness**: Helper functions avoiding dependent rewrites in Equiv goals
6. **✅ Clean API**: Level type, HeightAt function, satisfiesLevel predicates
