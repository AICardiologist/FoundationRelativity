## ✅ Phase 1 Achievements - Corresponding to Paper 3 LaTeX

### ✅ Complete Bicategorical Foundation (Phase1_Simple.lean)
1. **✅ Foundation 2-category**: Objects (foundations), 1-morphisms (interpretations), 2-morphisms  
2. **✅ Σ₀ pinned signature**: Standard interpretation with ℕ, Bool, ℝ, ℓ∞, c₀, quotient
3. **✅ Banach preservation**: Interpretations preserve finite/countable limits, completions, compactness
4. **✅ Coherence laws**: Pentagon and triangle identities for associators/unitors
5. **✅ Example foundations**: BISH, BISH+WLPO, ZFC with concrete inclusion map

## What Requires Implementation - Phases 2-4 🔧

2. **Natural transformations**: 2-categorical transformation theory
3. **ρ-hierarchy**: Ordinal arithmetic and strength classification
4. **Advanced coherence**: Gordon-Power-Street beyond basic pentagon/triangle

### 📋 Foundation-Relative Constructions (Phase 3: 2-3 weeks) 
1. **Functorial Obstruction Theorem**: Main technical result (restore from old_files/)
2. **Foundation morphisms**: Enhanced beyond current Interp structure
