# ⚠️ Paper 3 Formalization Status

**CRITICAL**: This paper is NOT actually formalized despite "0 sorries" claim.

## Current State

The files in this directory contain only placeholder stubs:
- All structures defined with single `dummy : Unit` field
- "Proofs" are trivial pattern matching on Unit
- No actual 2-categorical machinery implemented

## What's Missing

The actual mathematical content from the LaTeX paper is not formalized:
- Full bicategory of foundations
- Gordon-Power-Street coherence conditions
- Pseudo-functors and transformations
- ρ-hierarchy with ordinal arithmetic
- Functorial Obstruction Theorem
- Oplax limits and lax pullbacks

## Required Work

See [/CRITICAL_QA_NOTICE.md](/CRITICAL_QA_NOTICE.md) for the full work plan.

Estimated effort: 6-10 weeks with category theory and proof theory consultants.
