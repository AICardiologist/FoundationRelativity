/-! ### Basic Definitions for 2-Categorical Framework -/

/-- 2-categorical obstruction: A property that prevents certain functorial
    constructions from being strict, requiring pseudo-functors instead.
    TODO: Implement proper obstruction theory with coherence conditions 
    
    FIXME(junior‑prof, 2025‑08‑07):
    * This declaration currently uses a dummy witness.
    * It must be replaced by a genuine proof once universe
      constraints are solved (see issue Paper3-Blocker-U1).
-/
def CategoricalObstruction : Prop := sorry

/-- Pseudo-functor in the 2-categorical framework. Should map foundations
    to categories while preserving composition only up to isomorphism.
    TODO: Replace with proper mathlib4 PseudoFunctor when available
    
    FIXME(junior‑prof, 2025‑08‑07):
    * This declaration currently uses a dummy witness.
    * It must be replaced by a genuine proof once universe
      constraints are solved (see issue Paper3-Blocker-U2).

/-- Pentagon coherence property for pseudo-functors -/
def preservesPentagon (_F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor) : Prop := True  -- Simplified for universe refactor

/-- Witness elimination property -/
def eliminatesWitnesses (_F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor) : Prop := True  -- Simplified for universe refactor

/-! ### Helper Structures -/

-- Connection between bicategory and witness theory  
structure WitnessBicatConnection where
  witness_grpd : Foundation → Type
  coherence : Unit -- TODO: Proper coherence data after bicategorical integration
