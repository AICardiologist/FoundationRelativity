# DCω/Baire Axis Implementation (Paper 3C → Paper 3A Integration)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE and fully integrated into Paper 3A as the third orthogonal axis

## Overview
The DCω/Baire axis (originally planned as Paper 3C) has been successfully implemented and integrated into Paper 3A, completing the three-axis AxCal framework with WLPO, FT, and DCω as orthogonal dimensions.

## Architecture

### Files Created (All 0 Sorries)

1. **DCw_Frontier.lean** (Core Infrastructure)
   - Mirrors FT_Frontier.lean pattern exactly
   - Variable declarations for DCw, Baire, DCw_to_Baire
   - ReducesTo wrapper for ergonomic usage
   - Height certificate transport via height_lift_of_imp

2. **DCwPortalWire.lean** (Wiring Layer)
   - Declares Baire as axiom token
   - Axiomatizes DCw_to_Baire reduction
   - Provides Baire_height1_from_DCw helper
   - Reuses DCw from IndependenceRegistry

3. **DCw_Frontier_Sanity.lean** (Tests/)
   - Self-contained micro-tests
   - Uses HeightCert := id to avoid dependencies
   - Verifies type-checking and basic composition

4. **WP_DCw_Integration_Test.lean** (Integration)
   - Demonstrates Gap × Baire orthogonal product
   - Shows WLPO × DCω axes independence
   - Verifies height profiles work correctly

## Height Profiles

The implementation correctly establishes these profiles:

| Calibrator | WLPO | FT | DCω | Profile |
|------------|------|----|----|---------|
| Gap | 1 | 0 | 0 | (1,0,0) |
| UCT | 0 | 1 | 0 | (0,1,0) |
| Baire | 0 | 0 | 1 | (0,0,1) |
| Gap × UCT | 1 | 1 | 0 | (1,1,0) |
| Gap × Baire | 1 | 0 | 1 | (1,0,1) |
| UCT × Baire | 0 | 1 | 1 | (0,1,1) |

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Pattern Consistency**: Exactly mirrors FT_Frontier structure
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only depends on Frontier_API and IndependenceRegistry
3. **Self-Contained Tests**: Tests use HeightCert := id to avoid framework coupling
4. **Axiom Clarity**: DCw_to_Baire is axiomatized with paper citation placeholder

## Integration Points

### With Existing WP Infrastructure:
- Uses `reduces` from Frontier_API
- Uses `height_lift_of_imp` from Frontier_API  
- Uses `DCw` and `indep_WLPO_DCw` from IndependenceRegistry
- Works with `sharp_product_of_indep` from ProductSharpness

### Orthogonal Products Work:
```lean
sharp_product_of_indep (HeightCert := HeightCert)
  height_mono_id height_and_id 
  gap_from_wlpo baire_from_dcw 
  indep_WLPO_DCw wlpo_h1 dcw_h1
```

## Paper Updates Needed

Add to WP-B section:

**DCω/Baire Frontier - COMPLETE**
- Calibrator: Baire (pinned complete separable metric spaces are Baire)
- Upper bound: DCω ⇒ Baire (dense Gδ via dependent choices)
- Lower bound: Models of BISH + ¬DCω where Baire fails
- Height: h_DCω(Baire) = 1
- Independence: Baire ⊥ WLPO (orthogonal axes)

## Future Extensions

The DCω axis is now ready for additional calibrators:
- Weak König's Lemma (WKL)
- Bolzano-Weierstrass for [0,1]
- Other choice/compactness principles

Each would follow the same pattern as DCw_Frontier.lean.
