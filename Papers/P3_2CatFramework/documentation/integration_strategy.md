## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Universe Management Complexity:** Expert session must provide clear guidance
2. **Bicategorical Coherence:** Pentagon/triangle integration complexity  
3. **Mathematical Correctness:** Obstruction theorems must capture intended content
4. **Integration Compatibility:** Must not break existing Papers 1 & 2

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Expert Consultation:** Schedule follow-up sessions if needed
- **Incremental Implementation:** Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
- **Backward Compatibility Testing:** Comprehensive regression testing
- **Mathematical Validation:** Domain expert review if obstruction theorems unclear

### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ All 6 Paper 3 framework definitions compile without universe constraints
- ‚úÖ All obstruction theorems have complete proofs
- ‚úÖ Full integration with bicategorical infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Zero sorries in Paper 3 by end of September (Junior Professor target)

- **Integration Issues:** Early warning for compatibility problems

### Stakeholder Coordination  
- **Junior Professor:** Overall strategy validation and timeline management
- **Expert Consultants:** Technical guidance and universe management validation
- **Implementation Team:** Phase execution and testing coordination

**Target Completion:** End of September 2025 (Paper 3 zero-sorry status)
