# Paper 3B Proof-Theoretic Scaffold - FINAL RELEASE

**Release Date**: September 2, 2025  
**Status**: ‚ùÑÔ∏è **FROZEN** - Complete at 21 axioms
**Version**: v1.0-final  

## üéØ Achievement: Honest Schematic Limit Reached

Paper 3B has reached its **honest limit** at 21 axioms. This represents the fundamental boundary of what can be achieved with our schematic encoding approach, where formulas are represented as atoms (`Formula.atom`) rather than compositional structures.

## ‚úÖ What's Complete (0 Sorries)

### Core Theorems
- **RFN_Œ£‚ÇÅ ‚Üí Con**: Proven schematically without sorries
- **Collision machinery**: All collision theorems proven via Stage approach
- **Ladder constructions**: LCons, LReflect, LClass fully implemented
- **Height certificates**: Complete upper/lower bound infrastructure

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **Stage-based construction** solves circular dependencies
2. **Cross-ladder bridge** complete (collision_step_semantic as theorem)
3. **Tag system** uses pure notations (no bridge axioms needed)
4. **All ProofTheory modules** build with 0 sorries

## üìä Final Axiom Count: 21

### Paper 3B Specific (12 axioms)
- Height comparison: 2 axioms
- Classical bounds: 7 axioms (G1, G2, RFN lower bounds, hierarchy strictness)
- Internalization bridge: 1 axiom (RFN_implies_Con_formula)
- Core fixed-point: 1 axiom (con_implies_godel)
- Limit: 1 axiom (LClass_omega_eq_PA)

### Base Theory Infrastructure (9 axioms)
- Theory definitions: HA, PA, EA, ISigma1
- Relations: HA_weaker_PA
- Instances: EA/PA arithmetization and derivability

## üîí Why This is the Limit

Our schematic encoding prevents:
- **Instantiation**: Cannot derive ConsistencyFormula from RFN_Sigma1_Formula
- **Fixed-points**: Cannot prove con_implies_godel via diagonalization
- **Syntax manipulation**: No object-level quantifier operations

To go below 21 axioms would require adding minimal internalization (~50-100 LoC), but this would fundamentally change the architecture from schematic to syntactic.

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

```lean
-- Import Paper 3B components:
import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3B_Main

-- This aggregator provides all Paper 3B functionality
-- DO NOT import ProofTheory/* files directly in new code
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Separation from Paper 3A

Paper 3B is **FROZEN**. All future development should use Paper 3A components only:
- Use `Paper3A_Main.lean` for active development
- Never modify ProofTheory/* files
- See [`MASTER_DEPENDENCY_CHART.md`](MASTER_DEPENDENCY_CHART.md) for separation guide

## üìà Historical Progress

- Initial state: 30 axioms with sorries
- PR-5b: 24 axioms (Bot_is_FalseInN discharged)  
- PR-6: 21 axioms (collision_step_semantic discharged)
- PR-7: 21 axioms stable (collision_tag discharged)
- **September 2, 2025**: Declared complete at honest limit

## ‚úÖ Quality Metrics

- **Sorries**: 0
- **Axioms**: 21 (honest schematic limit)
- **CI Status**: All checks passing
- **Documentation**: Complete with AXIOM_INDEX.md
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive with #print axioms guards

## üéì Conclusion

Paper 3B represents a **complete, honest formalization** of proof-theoretic scaffolding within the constraints of schematic encoding. The 21 axioms are not a temporary state but the fundamental limit of this approach. The framework successfully demonstrates ladder constructions, collision theorems, and height certificates, providing a solid foundation for the broader AxCal project while maintaining mathematical integrity.
