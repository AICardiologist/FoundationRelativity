# Paper 3 Work Progress Tracker

## 2-Categorical Framework Implementation Status

---

### Phase 0: Problem Analysis ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Identified 6 universe constraint failures blocking Paper 3
- [x] Created minimal reproducible example
- [x] Documented constraint explosion pattern
- [x] Isolated placeholder work on feature branch

### Phase 1: Expert Preparation ✅ COMPLETE  
- [x] Added FIXME comments to all blocked definitions
- [x] Created GitHub issues #84-89 with detailed analysis
- [x] Implemented CI guard against placeholder code
- [x] Prepared dependency graph and target design
- [x] Ready for expert consultation session

### Phase 2: Universe Refactor ⏳ PENDING
**Waiting on Expert Session Results**
- [ ] Expert consultation with Mario/Floris/Patrick
- [ ] Finalize 3-level universe design (𝓤₀ ⊂ 𝓤₁ ⊂ 𝓤₂)
- [ ] Implement universe-polymorphic Foundation/Interp patterns
- [ ] Test approach with Paper 3 framework definitions

### Phase 3: Framework Implementation ⏳ BLOCKED
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 completion
- [ ] CategoricalObstruction implementation
- [ ] TwoCatPseudoFunctor implementation  
- [ ] obstruction_theorem proof
- [ ] obstruction_at_twocells proof
- [ ] pentagon_required_for_obstruction proof
- [ ] witness_groupoid_realizes_obstruction proof

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing ⏳ FUTURE
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 completion
- [ ] Bicategorical coherence axiom integration
- [ ] Witness groupoid theory integration
- [ ] Pentagon/triangle coherence proofs
- [ ] Full Paper 3 mathematical content
- [ ] Zero-sorry target achievement

## Current Blockers

**Primary Blocker:** Universe constraint explosion
- **Impact:** Blocks all 6 Paper 3 framework definitions
- **Solution:** Expert consultation + universe refactor
- **Timeline:** ~Week 3 (Junior Professor estimate)

**Secondary Blockers:** 
- Operator algebra stubs (Patrick Massot availability)
- Bicategorical infrastructure dependencies
- Pentagon/triangle coherence requirements
