  ⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE FOR NEW WORK ⚠️
  
  This file is deprecated as of September 2025.
  It has been replaced by separate aggregators for Papers 3A and 3B.
  
  MIGRATION GUIDE:
  ================
  Instead of importing this file, use:
  
  For Paper 3A work (active development):
    import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3A_Main
  
  For Paper 3B reference (frozen):
    import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3B_Main
  
  For transition period only:
    import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3_Transition
  
  See documentation/MASTER_DEPENDENCY_CHART.md for details.
  
  This file will be removed after full migration is complete.

/-! ### Summary Output -/

#eval IO.println "
Paper 3 Main Entry Point:
- Paper3_Integration.lean: Main results using P4_Meta
- P3_Minimal.lean: This file - executes Paper 3 via P4_Meta
- P4_Meta/*: Subsidiary proof infrastructure

When Paper 3 runs, it:
1. Sets up base theory (Paper3BaseTheory)
2. Creates height certificates for each result
3. Aggregates results using P4_Meta combinators
4. Proves all results hold at ω-limit
5. Exports LaTeX documentation

P4_Meta provides the meta-theoretic machinery that Paper 3 uses for:
- Proof height tracking
- Theory extension ladders
- Certificate aggregation
- ω-limit reasoning
