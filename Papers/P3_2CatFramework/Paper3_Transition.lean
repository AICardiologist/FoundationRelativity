  Transition Aggregator for Papers 3A & 3B
  
  This file helps with the migration from the old P3_Minimal.lean
  to the new separated Paper3A_Main.lean and Paper3B_Main.lean
  
  STATUS: Transition period (September 2025)
  
  After migration is complete, this file and P3_Minimal.lean
  should be deprecated in favor of the separate aggregators.

-- Import shared components needed by both papers
-- Note: Can't import both aggregators due to conflicts
-- This is why we need the separation!
import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3_Integration

-- For transition, users should migrate to use ONE of:
-- import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3A_Main (for 3A work)
-- import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3B_Main (for 3B reference)

MIGRATION GUIDE: P3_Minimal → Paper3A_Main / Paper3B_Main
=========================================================

Old way (deprecated):
  import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.P3_Minimal

New way (use this):
  -- For Paper 3A work:
  import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3A_Main
  
  -- For Paper 3B reference (frozen):
  import Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3B_Main

What changed:
- Clean separation between papers
- Paper 3B (ProofTheory) is now frozen
- Paper 3A continues active development
- No cross-dependencies allowed

See documentation/MASTER_DEPENDENCY_CHART.md for details.
