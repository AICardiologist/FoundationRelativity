  Purpose: WP-D Stone Window for Support Ideals
  - Generalizes Stone window beyond Fin to arbitrary Boolean ideals
  - Parameterized by rings with only trivial idempotents
  - Algebraic proof without topology or choice

-- The interface is provided as a minimal skeleton with 0 sorries
-- Full quotient construction and isomorphism proof deferred

/-! ### Calibration Program

The constructive principles needed for surjectivity of Î¦_I depend on I:
- For FinIdeal: constructively provable (no extra axioms)
- For DensityZeroIdeal: requires principles related to WLPO
- For other ideals: calibrate case by case

This provides a flexible testbed for measuring constructive strength.
