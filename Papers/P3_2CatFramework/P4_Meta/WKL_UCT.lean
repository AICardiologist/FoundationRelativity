  WKL → UCT axiom for the revised CRM calibration in Paper 3A.
  
  ## CRM Context
  
  In constructive reverse mathematics (CRM):
  - WKL (Weak König's Lemma) implies UCT over BISH
  - This provides a "shortcut" to UCT at height 0 on any ladder containing WKL
  - See Diener (2013) "Weak König's lemma implies the uniform continuity theorem"
