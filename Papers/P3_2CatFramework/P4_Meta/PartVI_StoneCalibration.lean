  CALIBRATION PROGRAM: Using the classical Stone window correspondence
  to measure constructive principles.
  
  The Stone correspondence Idem(ℓ∞/I_𝒥) ≅ 𝒫(ℕ)/𝒥 for support ideals is
  a classical result. We use it as a calibration tool: which constructive
  principles are needed to recover surjectivity for specific ideals?
  
  This file demonstrates that for block-finite ideals, surjectivity would
  imply WLPO, showing how classical results require omniscience principles
  in constructive settings. The calibration approach is our contribution,
  not the Stone correspondence itself.

/-! ### Block-finite support ideal

We define a specific combinatorial support ideal built from a canonical
partition of ℕ into blocks. This gives us a concrete Stone quotient
where surjectivity has computational content.

/-! ### WLPO and its encoding

WLPO states: for any binary sequence, either it's eventually zero or not.
We encode this as a formula in our abstract system.

/-! ### Stone calibration for block-finite ideals

We demonstrate that surjectivity of the Stone quotient map for the 
block-finite ideal implies WLPO. This calibrates the constructive
strength needed to recover the classical Stone correspondence.

The key insight: given a binary sequence b : ℕ → {0,1}, we encode it into
an idempotent representative modulo the block-finite ideal. Surjectivity
of the quotient map Φ_I forces a decision about b's eventual behavior.

/-- Main calibration: Stone surjectivity for block-finite ideal implies WLPO.
    
    Paper proof sketch:
    1. Given binary sequence b, encode it as idempotent [χ_A] where
       A = {n : b(n) = 1} intersected with canonical block representatives
    2. If Φ_BFI is surjective, there exists preimage set B with [χ_B] = [χ_A]  
    3. B and A differ by a set in the ideal (finitely many blocks)
    4. This forces a decision: either b is eventually 0 (B finite) or not
    5. Thus we obtain WLPO from the surjectivity assumption

/-! ### Positive case: rational-valued idempotents

For contrast, we also formalize the positive result: rational-valued
idempotents modulo any support ideal are constructively surjective.
