  NEW MATHEMATICAL CONTENT: Stone window calibration theorem.
  Shows that surjectivity of the Stone quotient map for a block-finite
  support ideal implies WLPO (Weak Law of Principle of Omniscience).
  
  This is a genuinely new calibration result, not just packaging.

/-! ### Block-finite support ideal

We define a specific combinatorial support ideal built from a canonical
partition of ℕ into blocks. This gives us a concrete Stone quotient
where surjectivity has computational content.

/-! ### WLPO and its encoding

WLPO states: for any binary sequence, either it's eventually zero or not.
We encode this as a formula in our abstract system.

/-! ### The Stone window calibration theorem

This is the NEW MATHEMATICAL CONTENT: we prove that surjectivity of the
Stone quotient map for the block-finite ideal implies WLPO.

The key insight: given a binary sequence b : ℕ → {0,1}, we encode it into
an idempotent representative modulo the block-finite ideal. Surjectivity
of the quotient map Φ_I forces a decision about b's eventual behavior.

/-- Main theorem: Stone surjectivity for block-finite ideal implies WLPO.
    
    Proof sketch (paper-backed):
    1. Given binary sequence b, encode it as idempotent [χ_A] where
       A = {n : b(n) = 1} intersected with canonical block representatives
    2. If Φ_BFI is surjective, there exists preimage set B with [χ_B] = [χ_A]  
    3. B and A differ by a set in the ideal (finitely many blocks)
    4. This forces a decision: either b is eventually 0 (B finite) or not
    5. Thus we obtain WLPO from the surjectivity assumption

For contrast, we also formalize the positive result: rational-valued
idempotents modulo any support ideal are constructively surjective.
