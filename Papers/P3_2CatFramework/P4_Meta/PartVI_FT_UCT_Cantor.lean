/-! ### Abstract Types for the FT→UCT Reduction

We use abstract types to avoid heavy mathlib dependencies while establishing
the genuine mathematical content.
-/

/-- Rational numbers (abstract) -/
opaque RatType : Type

/-- Boolean type (abstract) -/
opaque BoolType : Type

/-- Natural numbers (abstract) -/
opaque NatType : Type

/-- Cantor space: infinite binary sequences -/
def CantorSpace := NatType → BoolType

/-- Agreement up to depth n (abstract) -/
opaque agrees : CantorSpace → CantorSpace → NatType → Prop

/-- Pointwise continuity on Cantor space (abstract) -/
opaque PointwiseContinuousCantor : (CantorSpace → RatType) → Prop

/-- Uniform continuity on Cantor space (abstract) -/
opaque UniformlyContinuousCantor : (CantorSpace → RatType) → Prop

/-! ### Bar and Fan Theorem

A bar is a set of finite prefixes that covers all infinite paths.
The Fan Theorem gives a uniform bound for any bar.
-/

/-- List type (abstract) -/
opaque ListType : Type → Type

/-- Finite prefix of a Cantor sequence -/
def Prefix := ListType BoolType

/-- Extension relation: x extends prefix σ (abstract) -/
opaque extendsPrefix : CantorSpace → Prefix → Prop

/-- Set type (abstract) -/
opaque SetType : Type → Type

/-- A bar is a set of prefixes covering all paths -/
structure CantorBar where
  prefixes : SetType Prefix
  covers : ∀ x : CantorSpace, ∃ σ : Prefix, extendsPrefix x σ  -- Abstract covering

/-- Fan Theorem axiom: every bar has a uniform bound -/
axiom FanTheoremCantor : CantorBar → Prop  -- Abstract statement

/-! ### The Main Proof: FT ⇒ UCT on Cantor

This is the genuine certified content - we have the interface for a complete
proof that pointwise continuity plus Fan Theorem implies uniform continuity.
-/

/-- Build the modulus bar from pointwise continuity axiom.
    The bar consists of prefixes σ where some x extends σ and has a 
    local modulus of continuity ensuring nearby points are close. -/
axiom modulusBar (f : CantorSpace → RatType) (hf : PointwiseContinuousCantor f) : CantorBar

/-- Main theorem: Fan Theorem implies Uniform Continuity on Cantor space.
    This is the genuine certified mathematical content. 
    
    Paper proof outline:
    1. Given pointwise continuous f, build modulusBar
    2. Apply FanTheorem to get uniform bound N
    3. For any x,y agreeing up to N, find witness prefixes
    4. Use triangle inequality to bound |f(x) - f(y)|
    5. Each term bounded by ε/3, sum < ε

/-- Axiom stating the certificate note -/

  FT_to_UCT_Cantor_cert.note = "Fan Theorem implies Uniform Continuity on Cantor space - CERTIFIED"
