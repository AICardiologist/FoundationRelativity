# Junior Professor Communication Log

## Paper 3: 2-Categorical Framework Implementation

---

### 7 Aug 2025 - Initial Corrective Instructions

**Junior Professor Feedback:**
> Excellent execution. I reviewed the commit history, the new feat/paper3‑placeholders branch, the six GitHub issues #84–89, and the universe_constraint_minimal_example.lean file

**Tasks Assigned:**
1. ✅ Attach log of Lean errors from universe_constraint_minimal_example.lean to issue #84 
2. ✅ Add CI guard to fail build if any file contains TEMP/unsafe/placeholder
3. ⏳ Draft high-level design brief for universe refactor (Junior Prof task)
4. ⏳ Circulate meeting invite to experts (Junior Prof task)

**Guidance for Expert Session:**
- Demo minimal file with live compile showing constraint explosion
- Present dependency graph: Foundation → Interp → GenericWitness → obstruction defs  
- Show desired end-state with explicit universes 𝓤₀ ⊂ 𝓤₁ ⊂ 𝓤₂

**Long-range Outlook:**
- Universe pass expected ~week 3
- Operator algebra stubs to follow immediately after
- Paper 3 zero-sorry target: end of September

### Current Status (Aug 7 2025)

**Completed:**
- ✅ 6 GitHub issues created (#84-89) with detailed universe constraint analysis
- ✅ FIXME comments added to all framework stubs
- ✅ Minimal reproducible example created and tested
- ✅ CI guard implemented to prevent placeholder code on main
- ✅ Clean branch hygiene maintained (placeholders isolated on feature branch)

**Ready for Expert Consultation:**
- Detailed error traces attached to issue #84
- Dependency graph prepared showing constraint explosion
- Target universe design documented

**Blocked on:**
- Expert session with Floris van Doorn, Mario Carneiro, Patrick Massot
- High-level design brief from Junior Professor
- Universe refactor implementation approval
