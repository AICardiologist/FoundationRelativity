  Minimal reproducible example of the universe constraint failure
  blocking Paper 3 (2-Categorical Framework) implementation.
  
  This file demonstrates the fundamental issue preventing proper
  implementation of CategoricalObstruction and TwoCatPseudoFunctor.

/-! ### Minimal Universe Constraint Failure Example -/

-- This attempts to reproduce the exact universe constraint error
-- encountered when implementing CategoricalObstruction

/-- Minimal version of CategoricalObstruction that triggers the universe constraint failure -/
def MinimalCategoricalObstruction : Prop := 
  ∃ (F G : Foundation) (φ : Interp F G) (X : Type*), 
  Nonempty (GenericWitness F) ∧ IsEmpty (GenericWitness G)
-- Expected error: failed to infer universe levels in binder type

/-- Minimal version of TwoCatPseudoFunctor that triggers similar issues -/
def MinimalTwoCatPseudoFunctor : Type* := 
  (F G : Foundation) → Interp F G → Type*
-- Expected error: universe constraint failure

/-! ### Analysis of the Failure -/

/-
ACTUAL ERRORS REPRODUCED:

1. MinimalCategoricalObstruction triggers:
   - failed to infer universe levels in binder type Foundation.{?u.13, ?u.12}  
   - failed to infer universe levels in binder type Foundation.{?u.7, ?u.6}
   - failed to infer universe levels in binder type Interp.{?u.7, ?u.6, ?u.13, ?u.12} F G

2. MinimalTwoCatPseudoFunctor triggers:
   - stuck at solving universe constraint: u_1 =?= max (max (max (max (u_2+1) (?u.52+1)) (?u.53+1)) (?u.56+1)) (?u.57+1)

ANALYSIS:
The universe constraint failure occurs because:

1. Foundation.{u,v} requires explicit universe parameters but inference fails
2. GenericWitness takes Foundation as parameter, creating cascading constraints  
3. Existential quantification over Foundation creates complex universe dependencies
4. Lean 4's universe inference cannot resolve exponentially complex constraint equations

This represents a fundamental blocker for implementing:
- 2-categorical obstruction theory requiring quantification over foundations
- Pseudo-functors mapping between foundations at different universe levels  
- Witness groupoid integration with bicategorical structures

The failure blocks all six Paper 3 framework definitions and requires
expert consultation on universe polymorphism patterns for bicategorical
structures in Lean 4. The constraint equations grow exponentially complex
due to nested dependencies between Foundation, Interp, and GenericWitness types.
