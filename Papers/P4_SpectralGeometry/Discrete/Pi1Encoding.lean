# Π₁-Encoding of Spectral Conditions

This module shows that the spectral gap condition is a Π₁ statement over the
rationals, which is key for the undecidability result.

## Main Results

* `rayleighQuotient` - The Rayleigh quotient as a rational function
* `spectralGapPredicate` - The spectral gap condition as a Π₁ formula
* `encoding_is_pi1` - Proof that the encoding is genuinely Π₁

## Strategy

We show that "λ₁ ≥ threshold" can be expressed as:
  ∀ v ≠ 0, if v ⊥ constants then R(v) ≥ threshold
  
where R(v) is the Rayleigh quotient. Since this is a universal statement over
rational vectors with rational arithmetic, it's Π₁.
