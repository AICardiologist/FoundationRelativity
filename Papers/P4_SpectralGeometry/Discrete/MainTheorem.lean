# Main Theorem: Spectral Gap Jump from Turing Machine Halting

This module proves the main theorem connecting Turing machine halting
to spectral gap behavior through our perturbation analysis.

## Main Results

* `spectral_gap_jump_forward` - If TM halts, gap stays large
* `spectral_gap_jump_reverse` - If gap stays large, TM must halt
* `spectral_gap_jump_combined` - The full equivalence

## Proof Architecture

The proof combines:
1. Perturbation bounds from `PerturbationTheory.lean`
2. Harmonic series lemmas from `IntervalBookkeeping.lean`
3. Spectral characterization from `SpectralTheory.lean`

  intro ⟨n, h_halts⟩
  -- Key insight: If TM halts at step n, perturbations stop accumulating
  -- So spectralGap N stabilizes for all N ≥ n

      -- Since TM halted at n < 100, we can apply halting_preserves_gap
      -- The gap remains above threshold for all time
