# Paper 4 Transition Notice

**Date**: September 4, 2025

## Status
Paper 4 is undergoing a **complete direction change**. 

## Old Direction (Archived)
**Title**: Spectral Geometry - Undecidable eigenvalue problems on manifolds

**Content**: 
- 17 Lean files 
- ~75 sorries
- Focus on spectral geometry and logical undecidability

**Location**: All previous work has been archived to `archive/old_spectral_geometry_2025/`

## New Direction
**Title**: [To be determined]

**Status**: Clean slate - ready for new development

## Why the Change?
[To be filled in based on your new research direction]

## For Archaeologists
The old Paper 4 work is preserved but not maintained. It was suspended with:
- Discrete spectrum modules partially developed
- Geometry framework sketched
- Logic connections outlined
- Not integrated into CI (was already suspended)
