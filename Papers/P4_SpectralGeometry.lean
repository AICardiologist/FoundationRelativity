# Paper 4: Spectral Geometry - Neck Scaling Formalization

This module provides a minimal but complete formalization of the key analytical
result from Paper 4: the neck scaling theorem.

## Main Results

* `neck_scaling` - The first eigenvalue scales as h² for neck width h
* `spectral_gap_undecidable` - Undecidability via axiomatized bump encoding

## Implementation Notes

This is a focused "high-leverage" formalization that captures the analytical
heart of the paper in under 1,000 lines, rather than the full 15,000+ line
implementation that would be required for complete formalization.

The only axiom is `bump_shifts_eigenvalue`, which encodes the unproved
CPW-style geometric construction.
