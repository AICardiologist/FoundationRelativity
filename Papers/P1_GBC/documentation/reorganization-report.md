# Paper 1 Reorganization Report: Rank-One Toggle Kernel
**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**To**: Mathematics Team  
**From**: Development Team  
**Subject**: Refocusing Paper 1 to Minimal Rank-One Toggle Implementation

## Executive Summary

Following the completion of Paper 2's WLPO ↔ BidualGap formalization, we have refocused Paper 1 from a full Gödel-Banach correspondence to a minimal, library-quality implementation of the **rank-one toggle kernel** operator theory. This provides reusable mathematical components suitable for mathlib4 upstream while maintaining the conceptual connection to foundation-relativity.

## Module Contents and Status

### 1. **Projection.lean** (180 lines) ✅
**Purpose**: Clean API for orthogonal projections onto lines in Hilbert spaces

**Key Definitions**:
- `projLine u hu`: Projection onto span{u} for unit vector u
- Works over `IsROrC 𝕜` for both ℝ and ℂ

**Proven Properties**:
- ✅ Idempotent: P² = P
- ✅ Self-adjoint: P* = P  
- ✅ Norm: ‖P‖ = 1
- ✅ Fixed point: P(u) = u
- ✅ Range characterization: range(P) = span{u}
- ✅ Kernel characterization: ker(P) = span{u}^⊥

**Implementation Quality**: Mathlib4-ready, clean proofs, proper typeclasses

### 2. **Toggle.lean** (150 lines) ✅
**Purpose**: Define and analyze the toggle operator G(c) := id - c·P

**Key Definitions**:
- `G u hu c`: Toggle operator parameterized by Bool
- G(false) = id, G(true) = id - P

**Proven Properties**:
- ✅ Kernel: ker(G(true)) = span{u}, ker(G(false)) = {0}
- ✅ Range: range(G(true)) = span{u}^⊥, range(G(false)) = H
- ✅ Injectivity ↔ c = false
- ✅ Surjectivity ↔ c = false  
- ✅ Fredholm alternative: injective ↔ surjective
- ⚠️ Block decomposition (1 sorry - needs orthogonal decomposition theorem)

**Mathematical Significance**: Demonstrates Boolean encoding of logical constraints

### 3. **Spectrum.lean** (120 lines) 🔧
**Purpose**: Compute spectrum and essential spectrum

**Key Results**:
- ✅ σ(G(false)) = {1}
- ⚠️ σ(G(true)) = {0,1} (2 sorries - needs spectral mapping theorem)
- ✅ σ(id) = {1} proven from scratch
- ⚠️ σ_ess(G(c)) = {1} (2 sorries - needs Weyl's theorem)
- ✅ Eigenvalue computations

**Missing Dependencies**: 
- Spectral theory for idempotent operators
- Weyl's theorem for compact perturbations

### 4. **ShermanMorrison.lean** (140 lines) 🔧
**Purpose**: Inverse formula for I + αP when P is a projection

**Key Results**:
- ✅ Main theorem: (I + αP)⁻¹ = I - α/(1+α)P when 1+α ≠ 0
- ✅ Complete proof with left/right inverse verification
- ⚠️ Resolvent formula (1 sorry - needs careful spectrum analysis)
- ⚠️ Not invertible when α = -1 (1 sorry)

**Implementation Quality**: Clean algebraic proof, ready for mathlib4

### 5. **Fredholm.lean** (130 lines) 🔧
**Purpose**: Establish Fredholm properties and index theory

**Key Results**:
- ✅ Structure `FredholmData` capturing Fredholm properties
- ✅ G(false) is Fredholm with index 0 (ker = coker = 0)
- ⚠️ G(true) is Fredholm with index 0 (3 sorries - dimension calculations)
- ✅ Fredholm alternative connection
- ⚠️ Range closed property (1 sorry - needs closed subspace theory)

**Missing Dependencies**:
- Finite dimension calculations for span{u}
- Quotient space dimension theory

### 6. **Tutorial.lean** (160 lines) 📚
**Purpose**: Didactic examples for learning and teaching

**Examples Provided**:
- ✅ Concrete ℓ² computations with standard basis
- ✅ Projection properties verification
- ✅ Toggle operator behavior with different Booleans
- ✅ Spectrum verification examples
- ✅ Sherman-Morrison application (computing (I+2P)⁻¹)
- ✅ Foundation-relative interpretation
- ⚠️ Some orthogonality proofs left as exercises (3 sorries)

**Pedagogical Value**: Clear connection between operator theory and logic

## Reusability Analysis

### From Original Code (Core.lean)
**Successfully Extracted** (~60% reused):
- P_g projection definition → `projLine`
- Idempotent property → `projLine_idem`
- G operator definition → `G`
- Surjectivity characterization → `surjective_iff`
- Spectrum analysis → `spectrum_G`
- Injectivity ↔ surjectivity → `G_inj_iff_surj`

**Newly Implemented** (~40% new):
- Sherman-Morrison formula (complete algebraic proof)
- Self-adjoint property proof
- Tutorial examples
- Clean Fredholm structure
- Essential spectrum setup

**Removed** (Gödel-specific):
- Arithmetic layer dependencies
- Foundation-relativity pseudo-functor scaffolding
- Sigma1Formula enumeration
- Provability predicates
- LogicAxioms dependencies

## Technical Debt Summary

**Total Sorries**: 13 across all modules
- Projection.lean: 0 ✅
- Toggle.lean: 1 (orthogonal decomposition)
- Spectrum.lean: 4 (spectral theory gaps)
- ShermanMorrison.lean: 2 (analysis details)
- Fredholm.lean: 3 (dimension theory)
- Tutorial.lean: 3 (orthogonality exercises)

**Required Mathlib4 Additions**:
1. Spectral mapping theorem for polynomials
2. Weyl's theorem for compact perturbations
3. Orthogonal decomposition in Hilbert spaces
4. Dimension theory for span and quotients

## Upstream Strategy for mathlib4

### Phase 1: Core Components (Ready)

- `ShermanMorrison` main theorem - Ready for PR

### Phase 2: After Dependencies (Pending)

- Essential spectrum (needs Weyl's theorem)

### PR Strategy
1. **PR-A**: Projection helpers (can submit immediately)
2. **PR-B**: Sherman-Morrison for projections (can submit immediately)
3. **PR-C**: Toggle operator properties (after completing sorries)
4. **PR-D**: Spectrum results (after mathlib4 has dependencies)

## Comparison with Original Plan

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Submit PR for Projection.lean to mathlib4
   - Submit PR for Sherman-Morrison theorem
   - Complete orthogonal decomposition proof

2. **Short-term Goals**:
   - Research mathlib4's spectral theory capabilities
   - Complete dimension calculations
   - Resolve remaining sorries

3. **Long-term Vision**:
   - Full integration into mathlib4
   - Use as foundation for Paper 3's pseudo-functor theory
   - Educational resource for foundation-relativity

## Conclusion

The reorganization successfully transforms Paper 1 from a complex Gödel-specific formalization to a clean, minimal operator theory library. The rank-one toggle kernel provides:

1. **Mathematical Value**: Reusable components for mathlib4
2. **Pedagogical Value**: Clear examples of Boolean-parameterized operators
3. **Conceptual Value**: Maintains foundation-relativity narrative without meta-level complexity

The implementation is approximately 70% complete, with clear paths to completion for the remaining sorries. The modular structure allows immediate upstream contribution of completed components while continuing work on the more complex spectral theory aspects.
