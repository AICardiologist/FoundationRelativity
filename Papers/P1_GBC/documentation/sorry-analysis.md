## Detailed Analysis by File

### 1. Projection.lean (1 sorry)
**Line 34**: Continuity of projection operator
```lean
cont := by
  -- Continuity follows from inner product and scalar multiplication being continuous
  sorry
```
**Context**: Need to prove continuity of `x ↦ ⟪u, x⟫ • u`
**Fix**: Use composition of continuous functions (inner product and scalar multiplication)
**Difficulty**: Easy - standard mathlib lemmas available

### 2. Toggle.lean (1 sorry)
**Line 171**: Block decomposition theorem
```lean
lemma block_decomposition_true (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) [CompleteSpace H] :
    LinearMap.ker (G u hu true).toLinearMap ⊔ LinearMap.range (G u hu true).toLinearMap = ⊤ := by
  -- H = span{u} ⊕ span{u}^⊥ for complete spaces
  sorry
```
**Context**: Need orthogonal decomposition H = span{u} ⊕ span{u}^⊥
**Fix**: Use Hilbert space orthogonal decomposition theorem
**Difficulty**: Medium - requires complete space assumption

### 3. Spectrum.lean (5 sorries)
**Line 58**: Spectrum of projection
```lean
lemma spectrum_projection (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) :
    spectrum 𝕜 (projLine u hu) ⊆ {0, 1} := by
  sorry -- This requires spectral theory for idempotent operators
```
**Fix**: Use idempotent spectrum theorem
**Difficulty**: Medium - may need to prove from scratch

**Line 70**: Spectrum of G(true)
```lean
theorem spectrum_G_true (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) :
    spectrum 𝕜 (G u hu true) = {0, 1} := by
  sorry -- This requires spectral mapping theorem for polynomials
```
**Fix**: Apply spectral mapping theorem for polynomial p(λ) = 1 - λ
**Difficulty**: Hard - spectral mapping theorem may not be in mathlib

**Line 89**: Compact operator proof
```lean
lemma projLine_compact (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) :
    IsCompactOperator (projLine u hu) := by
  sorry -- This requires showing the range is finite-dimensional
```
**Fix**: Show range is 1-dimensional hence compact
**Difficulty**: Medium

**Lines 99, 102**: Essential spectrum
```lean
theorem essentialSpectrum_G (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) (c : Bool) :
    essentialSpectrum 𝕜 (G u hu c) = {1} := by
  cases c
  · sorry -- Need to show essential spectrum of identity is {1}
  · sorry -- This requires Weyl's theorem for compact perturbations
```
**Fix**: Need Weyl's theorem for compact perturbations
**Difficulty**: Hard - essential spectrum theory may be missing from mathlib

### 4. ShermanMorrison.lean (3 sorries)
**Line 85**: Non-unit proof for I - P
```lean
lemma not_isUnit_id_sub_proj (P : H →L[𝕜] H) (hP : P.comp P = P) 
    (hP_ne_zero : P ≠ 0) (hP_ne_id : P ≠ ContinuousLinearMap.id 𝕜 H) :
    ¬IsUnit (ContinuousLinearMap.id 𝕜 H - P) := by
  sorry
```
**Fix**: Show kernel is nontrivial
**Difficulty**: Easy

**Line 109**: Resolvent for c = true case
```lean
theorem resolvent_G (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) (c : Bool) (λ : 𝕜) 
    (hλ : λ ∉ spectrum 𝕜 (G u hu c)) :
  ...
  · -- c = true: G = I - P, so λI - G = (λ-1)I + P
    sorry -- This requires more careful analysis of the spectrum
```
**Fix**: Apply Sherman-Morrison with α = 1/(λ-1)
**Difficulty**: Medium - needs careful case analysis

**Line 119**: Resolvent norm bound
```lean
lemma resolvent_norm_bound (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) (c : Bool) (λ : 𝕜)
    (hλ : λ ∉ spectrum 𝕜 (G u hu c)) :
    ... := by
  sorry
```
**Fix**: Standard resolvent estimate using distance to spectrum
**Difficulty**: Medium

### 5. Fredholm.lean (4 sorries)
**Line 68**: Fredholm data for G(true)
```lean
theorem fredholm_G_true (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) :
    ∃ data : FredholmData (G u hu true),
      data.finrank_ker = 1 ∧ 
      data.finrank_coker = 1 ∧
      fredholmIndex (G u hu true) data = 0 := by
  sorry -- This requires showing:
        -- 1. span{u} is 1-dimensional (clear)
        -- 2. codim(span{u}^⊥) = 1
        -- 3. The range is closed (it's a closed subspace)
```
**Fix**: Prove dimensions and closed range
**Difficulty**: Medium - standard Hilbert space theory

**Lines 99, 105**: Dimension calculations
```lean
theorem dim_ker_coker_G_true (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) :
    (finrank 𝕜 (LinearMap.ker (G u hu true).toLinearMap) = 1) ∧
    (finrank 𝕜 (H ⧸ LinearMap.range (G u hu true).toLinearMap) = 1) := by
  constructor
  · sorry  -- finrank of span of a single nonzero vector is 1
  · sorry  -- The quotient H/span{u}^⊥ is isomorphic to span{u}
```
**Fix**: Use dimension theory for spans and quotients
**Difficulty**: Easy - standard linear algebra

**Line 133**: Closed range property
```lean
theorem range_closed_G (u : H) (hu : ‖u‖ = 1) (c : Bool) :
    IsClosed (LinearMap.range (G u hu c).toLinearMap : Set H) := by
  ...
  · -- c = true: range = span{u}^⊥ is closed
    sorry  -- Orthogonal complement is always closed
```
**Fix**: Use fact that orthogonal complements are closed
**Difficulty**: Easy - standard result

### 6. Tutorial.lean (5 sorries)
**Lines 48, 68, 69, 127**: Example computations
- Orthogonality of basis vectors in ℓ²
- Nonzero property of basis vectors
- Concrete computation examples

**Fix**: Standard ℓ² basis properties
**Difficulty**: Easy - pedagogical examples

## Priority Classification

5. Tutorial examples (2)

### Medium Difficulty (8 sorries)
1. Block decomposition
2. Idempotent spectrum

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate fixes**: Complete the 7 easy sorries using standard mathlib results
2. **Short-term**: Work on medium difficulty proofs, especially those with clear mathematical paths
3. **Long-term**: Either:
   - Wait for mathlib4 to add spectral mapping and essential spectrum theory
   - Contribute these missing pieces to mathlib4
   - Accept some sorries as "axioms" for spectral theory results

The implementation is functionally complete with clear mathematical content. The sorries are primarily technical gaps rather than conceptual issues.
