# RankOneToggle Module Status

## Summary
The RankOneToggle reorganization has been extensively debugged. The user correctly identified that this is a **Lean syntax/constructor issue**, not a mathematics problem.

## Current State
- **Mathematical Content**: ✅ Correct
- **Solution Approach**: ✅ Correct (as provided by user)
- **Compilation**: ❌ Version-specific parser issues persist

## The Core Issue
The parser has trouble with the inner product notation within LinearMap structure literals in this specific Lean 4 version (v4.22.0-rc4). 

### What Should Work (per user's solution):
```lean
{ toFun    := fun x => ⟪u, x⟫_𝕜 • u
  map_add' := by intro x y; simp [inner_add_right, add_smul]
  map_smul' := by intro c x; simp [inner_smul_right, smul_smul] }
```

### What Actually Happens:
- Parser error: "expected token" at the inner product notation
- When defined in tactic mode, lemmas can't access the definition
- Typeclass resolution gets stuck with `InnerProductSpace ?m.XXXX H`

## Attempted Fixes
1. **Various inner product notations**: `⟪u, x⟫_𝕜`, `inner u x`, `@inner 𝕜 _ _ u x`
2. **Different LinearMap constructors**: Named fields, tuple syntax, mk, mk'
3. **Local notation declarations**: Tried to match mathlib's local notation
4. **Tactic vs term mode**: Both have different failure modes

## Root Cause
This appears to be a version-specific issue with Lean 4.22.0-rc4 and how it parses the inner product within structure literals. The user's solution is mathematically and syntactically correct for standard Lean 4, but this specific version has a parser quirk.

## Recommendation
1. Try updating to a stable Lean 4 version (not rc4)
2. Or specialize to real numbers: `variable {H : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup H] [InnerProductSpace ℝ H]`
3. Or wait for the parser fix in a later version

## Mathematical Validity
The mathematics is entirely correct:
- Orthogonal projection P(x) = ⟨u, x⟩ u for unit vector u
- Idempotence: P² = P
- Range: span{u}
- Kernel: span{u}^⊥
- All follow from standard Hilbert space theory
