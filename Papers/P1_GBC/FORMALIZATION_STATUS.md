# ⚠️ Paper 1 Formalization Status

**WARNING**: This paper is only ~75% properly formalized despite "0 sorries" claim.

## Current State

While Paper 1 is in better shape than Papers 2 & 3, it still has significant issues:

### Genuine Proofs (~75%)
- Most basic definitions and lemmas are properly formalized
- Appendices mostly contain legitimate forwarders to mathlib
- Foundation definitions compile correctly

### Problematic "Cheap Proofs" (12 instances)
The following critical results use Unit/() tricks instead of real proofs:

1. **Main Survey Theorem** (`Papers/P1_Survey/SurveyTheorem.lean`)
   - Claims to prove that every analytic obstruction is reflected by ordinal-indexed 2-functor ρ
   - "Proof" is 11 lines that imports PseudoFunctor but ends with `exact ⟨()⟩`
   - Never actually uses the categorical machinery

2. **Two Reflection Lemmas** (Set↔Type, CZF↔HoTT)
   - These should be substantial proofs about foundation bridges
   - Currently just `by trivial`

3. **Other cheap proofs** scattered throughout

## What's Missing

Key components that need real implementation:
- `Cat/OrdinalRho.lean` - Definition of ordinal-valued 2-functor ρ
- `Logic/Reflection.lean` - Proper proofs of reflection principles
- `Cat/SurveyTheoremProof.lean` - Real proof using the bicategory machinery

## Why This Matters

The Survey Theorem is the **main result** of Paper 1. Having it "proved" by `exact ⟨()⟩` means the paper's central claim is not actually verified.

## Required Work

See [/CRITICAL_QA_NOTICE.md](/CRITICAL_QA_NOTICE.md) for the full work plan.

Estimated effort: 2-3 weeks with ordinal consultant (1 week).

## Detection

Run the cheap proofs linter:
```bash
lake exe cheap_proofs
```

This will flag all 12 problematic proofs that need to be replaced with real mathematics.
