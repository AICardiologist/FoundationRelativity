# Paper 5: [Title TBD] - Main Entry Point

This is the main entry point for Paper 5, which builds on the complete
AxCal framework from Papers 1-4 (all frozen).

## Available Infrastructure

The complete AxCal ecosystem is available for use:

- Paper 3A: `Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3A_Main`
  - Three orthogonal axes (WLPO, FT, DCω)
  - Uniformization height theory
  - Stone Window API with 100+ lemmas

- Paper 3B: `Papers.P3_2CatFramework.Paper3B_Main` 
  - Proof-theoretic scaffold (21 axioms)
  - Stage-based ladder system
  - Collision theory framework

- Paper 4: `Papers.P4_SpectralGeometry.Smoke`
  - Quantum spectral calibrations (S0-S4)
  - Profile algebra and composition laws
  - Markov's Principle integration

## Development Status

Papers 1-4 are frozen as of September 2025:
- paper1-freeze-v1.0: Rank-One Toggle (4 sorries)
- paper2-freeze-v1.0: WLPO ↔ Gap (3 conditional sorries)  
- paper3a-freeze-v1.0: AxCal Framework (0 sorries)
- paper3b-freeze-v1.0: Proof Theory (21 axioms)
- paper4-freeze-v1.0: Quantum Spectra (0 sorries, Zenodo)

Paper 5 development begins fresh from this stable foundation.
