## Questions for Professor

From `VERIFICATION_MEMO.md`:

### Q1: Is Level 2 status acceptable for publication?
- Current: Ready with justified axioms
- Level 3: 4-6 weeks additional work required

### Q2: Need additional documentation?
- File header "Future Work" section?
- More detailed axiom justifications?
- Architectural decision log?

### Q3: Concerns about alternation identity sorries?
- Currently deferred per Category C mandate
- Can eliminate if required (~2 weeks)
- Not blocking vacuum solution
