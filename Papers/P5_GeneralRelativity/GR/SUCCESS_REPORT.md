# Success: Professor's Sequenced Simplification Strategy

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Both f(r) compatibility lemmas proven
**Error Reduction:** 34 → 32 errors

## Executive Summary

The professor's **Sequenced Simplification Strategy** successfully resolved the algebraic closure issue in both `compat_r_tt_ext` and `compat_r_rr_ext`. Both lemmas are now **fully proven** with no sorries.

## What Was Fixed

### compat_r_tt_ext (lines 617-636)
**Statement:** `∂_r g_{tt} = 2 Γ^t_{rt} g_{tt}` on Exterior Domain

**Fix Applied:**
```lean
-- Old (failed): simp only [dCoord_r, Γtot_t_rt, Γ_t_tr, f]
-- New (works): simp only [dCoord_r, Γtot_t_rt, Γ_t_tr]  -- NO 'f'!
rw [h_deriv]  -- Now pattern matches while f is still abstract
field_simp [hr_ne, hf_ne, pow_two, sq]  -- Closes the goal completely
```

### compat_r_rr_ext (lines 639-657)
**Statement:** `∂_r g_{rr} = 2 Γ^r_{rr} g_{rr}` on Exterior Domain

**Fix Applied:** Identical pattern
```lean
simp only [dCoord_r, Γtot_r_rr, Γ_r_rr]  -- NO 'f'!
rw [h_deriv]
field_simp [hr_ne, hf_ne, pow_two, sq]  -- Closes the goal
```

## The Key Insight

**Professor's Solution:** Control the unfolding sequence
1. Expand structural definitions (dCoord, Γtot) but **exclude** `f`
2. Apply derivative lemma `h_deriv` while `f` is still abstract (pattern matches!)
3. Let `field_simp` handle algebraic cancellation with abstract `f`

**Why This Works:**
- When `f` is abstract, `rw [h_deriv]` can match `deriv (fun s => -f M s)` in the goal
- `field_simp` then unfolds `f` implicitly during normalization
- Result: algebraic closure succeeds

## Verification

✅ **Both lemmas compile without errors**
✅ **No "unsolved goals" at lines 617-636 or 639-657**
✅ **Error count reduced from 34 → 32**
✅ **No sorries in either proof**

## Current Status

### Working Compatibility Lemmas (5/5 targeted)
1. ✅ `compat_r_θθ_ext` - polynomial derivative (r²)
2. ✅ `compat_r_φφ_ext` - polynomial derivative (r²·sin²θ)
3. ✅ `compat_θ_φφ_ext` - trigonometric derivative (sin²θ)
4. ✅ `compat_r_tt_ext` - f(r) derivative (NEW!)
5. ✅ `compat_r_rr_ext` - f(r)⁻¹ derivative (NEW!)

### Remaining Work
- Line 682: `dCoord_g_via_compat_ext` (unified lemma) - has unsolved goals because not all 64 cases covered
- Line 706: `nabla_g_zero_ext` - depends on unified lemma
- Lines 2678-3356: Stage-2 Riemann proofs - depend on `nabla_g_zero`

### Error Breakdown
- **Baseline:** 50 errors (start of Hybrid Strategy)
- **After simple lemmas:** 34 errors
- **After f(r) lemmas:** 32 errors (6% improvement, 36% total)
- **Remaining:** Mostly Stage-2 Riemann proofs that depend on `nabla_g_zero`

## Architectural Soundness

✅ **Exterior Domain restriction** - All lemmas proven only for r > 2M
✅ **Mathematical validity** - No division by zero issues
✅ **Binder penetration** - `dsimp only [g]` pattern works
✅ **@[simp] tags** - All 5 targeted lemmas marked for automation
✅ **REPP pattern** - Robust Exterior Proof Pattern established

## Bottom Line

The professor's solution was exactly right. By controlling the order of unfolding—keeping `f` abstract during the `rw [h_deriv]` step—we bypassed the definitional vs propositional mismatch that blocked all previous attempts.

**The Hybrid Strategy is now 100% complete for targeted compatibility lemmas.** The remaining work is in the unified exhaustive lemma and downstream Riemann proofs.
