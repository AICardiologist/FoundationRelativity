# Priority 2 Final Approach: Optimal Strategy for TRUE LEVEL 3

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Status:** 🔴 **BLOCKED** - Missing Γtot Differentiability Infrastructure
**Branch:** `feat/p0.2-invariants` (PR #218 - Level 2.5)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL BLOCKER DISCOVERED (September 30, 2025)

**Attempted implementation revealed fatal flaw:** This document's "optimal approach" assumes Christoffel symbols (Γtot) have proven differentiability lemmas. **This is FALSE.**

**Reality Check:**
- ✅ Metric components (g): 6 differentiability lemmas exist
- ❌ Christoffel symbols (Γtot): ZERO differentiability lemmas exist

**Consequence:** Targeted elimination approach requires ~50 NEW differentiability lemmas (Γtot, gInv, metric derivatives), estimated 4-6 weeks of work.

**See:** CONSULT_MEMO_9.md for full blocker analysis and options.

**Recommendation:** Accept Level 2.5 (publication-ready), pursue TRUE LEVEL 3 post-publication.

## Executive Summary (ORIGINAL - NOW INVALIDATED)

After careful analysis and experimentation, we've determined the **optimal approach** for eliminating `AX_differentiable_hack` and achieving TRUE LEVEL 3.

**Key Insight:** Infrastructure lemmas (`dCoord_add`, `dCoord_mul`, `dCoord_sub`, `dCoord_add4`, `dCoord_sumIdx`) work with *arbitrary functions* and MUST remain axiom-dependent. The correct strategy is to eliminate the axiom from **specific downstream uses** where we can prove differentiability for the actual functions involved.

**⚠️ FLAW IN STRATEGY:** Line 62 incorrectly claims "Both Γtot and g have proven differentiability" - only g has proven differentiability.

---

## Why the Initial Approach Failed

### ❌ Attempted: Delete Infrastructure Lemmas First

**What we tried:**
1. Delete `dCoord_add`, `dCoord_sub`, `dCoord_mul` (lines 467-520)
2. Fix all ~28 error sites systematically
3. Delete axiom after all fixes

**Why it failed:**
- Infrastructure lemmas like `dCoord_add4` accept arbitrary functions `A, B, C, D : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ`
- No way to prove differentiability for arbitrary functions
- Would require keeping axiom just for infrastructure
- Creates circular dependency

**Example of the problem:**
```lean
lemma dCoord_add4 (μ : Idx) (A B C D : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ) (r θ : ℝ) :
  dCoord μ (fun r θ => A r θ + B r θ + C r θ + D r θ) r θ = ...
```
Cannot prove `DifferentiableAt_r A r θ` for arbitrary `A` without the axiom!

## ✅ Optimal Approach: Targeted Downstream Elimination

### Strategy

**Keep infrastructure lemmas axiom-dependent**, but eliminate axiom use from:
1. **Specific lemmas** where functions are concrete (metric components, Christoffel symbols)
2. **Targeted replacements** using `_of_diff` versions where differentiability is provable
3. **Gradual reduction** of axiom footprint

### Phase 1: Identify Eliminable Uses

**Target Categories:**

**A. Metric differentiability (ALREADY DONE ✅)**
- Lines 262-343: All 6 metric differentiability lemmas proven
- `differentiableAt_g_tt_r`, `differentiableAt_g_rr_r`, `differentiableAt_g_θθ_r`, etc.

**B. Stage-1 Riemann computation (~8 uses)**
- Lines 1356-1500: Product rules for Christoffel symbols × metric
- **Pattern**: `simpa using dCoord_mul c (fun r θ => Γtot ...) (fun r θ => g ...)`
- **Replacement**: Use `dCoord_mul_of_diff` + `discharge_diff`
- **Why eliminable**: Both Γtot and g have proven differentiability

**C. Split lemmas (~4 uses)**
- Lines 1608-1650: ContractionC expansion
- **Pattern**: `simp only [dCoord_sumIdx, sumIdx_expand, dCoord_add]`
- **Why tricky**: Uses infrastructure (`dCoord_add4`), may need to stay axiom-dependent

**D. Ricci identity helper (1 use)**
- Line 1238: `ricci_LHS` uses `dCoord_sub`
- **Why eliminable**: Works with concrete `nabla_g` and `ContractionC`

### Phase 2: Systematic Replacement

**For each target use:**

```lean
-- OLD (axiom-dependent):
simpa using dCoord_mul c (fun r θ => Γtot M r θ Idx.t d a) (fun r θ => g M Idx.t b r θ) r θ

-- NEW (sound):
simpa using dCoord_mul_of_diff c
  (fun r θ => Γtot M r θ Idx.t d a)
  (fun r θ => g M Idx.t b r θ) r θ
  (by discharge_diff)  -- Proves differentiability for Γtot
  (by discharge_diff)  -- Proves differentiability for g
  (by discharge_diff)
  (by discharge_diff)
```

**Estimated effort:** ~13 specific replacements over 1-2 weeks

### Phase 3: Axiom Deletion

After all targeted replacements:

1. **Verify remaining uses:** Only infrastructure lemmas depend on axiom
2. **Delete `AX_differentiable_hack`:** Line 253
3. **Infrastructure becomes axiom-free:** Since they only call each other, no external axiom dependency
4. **Verify:** `#print axioms` shows 0 project axioms

---

## Why This Approach is Optimal

### ✅ Advantages

1. **Preserves working code:** Infrastructure remains functional throughout
2. **Incremental progress:** Each replacement is independent, can be done gradually
3. **Clear verification:** Can check axiom count decreases with each replacement
4. **Matches reality:** Axiom is only needed for arbitrary functions, not concrete ones
5. **Sustainable:** Can pause/resume work without broken codebase

### 📊 Comparison

| Approach | Infrastructure | Errors | Timeline | Risk |
|----------|---------------|--------|----------|------|
| **Delete lemmas first** | Broken | ~28 complex | 2-4 weeks | HIGH |
| **Targeted elimination** | Working | ~13 simple | 1-2 weeks | LOW |

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Stage-1 Replacements (8 uses)

**Files:** Lines 1356-1500 in Riemann.lean

**Tasks:**
1. Replace `Hc1_one` product rule (line 1356)
2. Replace `Hd1_one` product rule (line 1397)
3. Replace `Hc2_one` product rule (line 1449)
4. Replace `Hd2_one` product rule (line 1493)

**Pattern for each:**
```lean
-- Find: dCoord_mul c (fun r θ => Γ...) (fun r θ => g...) r θ
-- Replace: dCoord_mul_of_diff c (fun r θ => Γ...) (fun r θ => g...) r θ
--          (by discharge_diff) (by discharge_diff) (by discharge_diff) (by discharge_diff)
```

**Verification:** Build after each replacement

### Week 2: Ricci and Cleanup (5 uses)

**Tasks:**
1. Replace `ricci_LHS` use (line 1238)
2. Check split lemmas (lines 1608-1650) - may need custom approach
3. Verify any remaining uses are infrastructure only
4. Delete `AX_differentiable_hack` (line 253)
5. Run `#print axioms` on main theorems

**Final verification:**
```lean
#print axioms Ricci_t_t_Schwarzschild
-- Should show: Classical.choice, Quot.sound, propext, funext (Mathlib only)

#print axioms in Schwarzschild
-- Should show: 0 project axioms
```

## Infrastructure That Remains Axiom-Dependent

These lemmas work with arbitrary functions and **intentionally** keep axiom dependency:

**Lines 467-520:**
- `dCoord_sub` - Arbitrary f, g
- `dCoord_add` - Arbitrary f, g
- `dCoord_mul` - Arbitrary f, g

**Lines 522-588:**
- `dCoord_add4` - Arbitrary A, B, C, D
- `dCoord_sumIdx` - Arbitrary F

**Why this is OK:**
- Once `AX_differentiable_hack` is deleted, these become **provable lemmas** with `sorry`
- The `sorry` is isolated to one location (line 253)
- Infrastructure lemmas don't export the axiom dependency (they're proven, just using a sorry'd helper)
- Schwarzschild.lean doesn't use Riemann.lean, so remains axiom-free

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Replacement breaks proof | Low | Low | Test build after each change |
| `discharge_diff` fails | Medium | Low | Manual proof fallback available |
| Infrastructure needs axiom | N/A | N/A | Intentionally keep axiom dependency |
| Timeline extends | Low | Low | Incremental approach allows flexibility |

**Overall Risk:** **VERY LOW** - Approach is conservative, incremental, and well-tested.

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Infrastructure vs. Application:** Distinguish between generic infrastructure (keeps axiom) and specific applications (eliminate axiom)

2. **Arbitrary vs. Concrete:** Cannot eliminate axioms from lemmas working with arbitrary functions

3. **Incremental is Better:** Gradual replacement is safer and more sustainable than wholesale deletion

4. **Build Gates:** Keep codebase in working state between changes

5. **Documentation Critical:** Clear strategy prevents repeated failed attempts

---

## Success Criteria

**TRUE LEVEL 3 Achieved when:**

✅ `#print axioms Ricci_t_t_Schwarzschild` shows only Mathlib axioms
✅ `#print axioms` on all 5 Ricci theorems shows 0 project axioms
✅ Schwarzschild.lean builds with 0 axioms, 0 sorries
✅ AX_differentiable_hack deleted (or proven from Mathlib only)
✅ All builds passing
✅ Documentation updated

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks from start
