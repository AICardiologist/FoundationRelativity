## Blocked: ricci_LHS Tactical Issue

### Problem Statement

Applied your linearization sequence to `ricci_LHS` (lines 1511-1554):

```lean
lemma ricci_LHS (M r θ : ℝ) (a b c d : Idx) :
  ( dCoord c (fun r θ => nabla_g M r θ d a b) r θ
  - dCoord d (fun r θ => nabla_g M r θ c a b) r θ )
  = - ( dCoord c (fun r θ => ContractionC M r θ d a b) r θ
        - dCoord d (fun r θ => ContractionC M r θ c a b) r θ ) := by
  -- 1. ✅ Expand definition
  simp only [nabla_g_eq_dCoord_sub_C]

  -- 2. ✅ Prove Clairaut's theorem
  have h_commute :
      dCoord c (fun r θ => dCoord d (fun r θ => g M a b r θ) r θ) r θ
    = dCoord d (fun r θ => dCoord c (fun r θ => g M a b r θ) r θ) r θ := by
    -- [Proof by cases - works fine]

  -- 3. ❌ FAILS HERE
  simp only [h_commute]  -- Error: `simp` made no progress
  ring
```

### Root Cause

After `simp only [nabla_g_eq_dCoord_sub_C]`, the goal expands `nabla_g` to:
```lean
dCoord d (fun r θ => g M a b r θ) r θ - ContractionC M r θ d a b
```

When this is substituted into the outer `dCoord` applications, the resulting goal structure doesn't contain the exact pattern `dCoord c (fun r θ => dCoord d (fun r θ => g M a b r θ) r θ) r θ` that `h_commute` proves.

**Hypothesis:** The pattern is buried in a more complex expression involving subtractions and the outer dCoord hasn't been distributed yet.

### What We Tried

1. **Linearization first:** `simp only [dCoord_sub_of_diff]` → Failed (requires differentiability hypotheses)
2. **discharge_diff:** `any_goals { try { discharge_diff } }` → No effect (no goals to discharge at that point)
3. **Direct rewrite:** `rw [h_commute]` → Same error (pattern doesn't match)
4. **Simp-based:** `simp only [h_commute]` → No progress

## Specific Questions

### Q1: Goal Structure After Expansion

After `simp only [nabla_g_eq_dCoord_sub_C]`, what is the exact goal structure?

**Our hypothesis:** Something like:
```lean
( dCoord c (fun r θ => dCoord d (fun r θ => g M a b r θ) r θ - ContractionC M r θ d a b) r θ
- dCoord d (fun r θ => dCoord c (fun r θ => g M a b r θ) r θ - ContractionC M r θ c a b) r θ )
= - ( dCoord c (fun r θ => ContractionC M r θ d a b) r θ
    - dCoord d (fun r θ => ContractionC M r θ c a b) r θ )
```

If so, we need to:
1. Distribute the outer `dCoord` over the subtraction inside
2. THEN `h_commute` will match the resulting `dCoord c (dCoord d g)` terms

**But:** How to distribute `dCoord` when differentiability hypotheses aren't available?

### Q2: Should We Use `conv`?

Would a `conv` block targeting the specific subterms work?

```lean
conv_lhs => {
  arg 1  -- First dCoord c application
  arg 1  -- The function inside
  rw [h_commute]
}
```

Or is there a better structural approach?

### Q3: Alternative Proof Strategy?

Should we prove `ricci_LHS` differently?

**Option A:** Expand everything to raw `deriv` applications, prove commutativity at that level, then re-package?

**Option B:** Prove intermediate lemmas about `dCoord (dCoord g - ContractionC)` specifically?

**Option C:** Use a different definition expansion order?

## Impact on Timeline

**Currently blocked on Phase 3.2** (decomposition of Riemann_alternation) because:
- Riemann_alternation proof uses `ricci_LHS` at line 3410
- Cannot proceed with alternation proof until this dependency is resolved

**Estimated time to resolve (with guidance):** 30 min - 1 hour

---

## Current Status

- **Build:** ✅ 0 errors
- **Active sorries:** 2
  1. `ricci_LHS` (line 1554) - BLOCKED on tactical guidance
  2. `Riemann_alternation` (line 3429) - Awaiting ricci_LHS + Phase 3.2

- **Codebase:** Clean, lean, ready for Phase 3.2

---

## Request

**Please provide specific tactical guidance for one of:**

1. How to make `h_commute` match after `nabla_g` expansion
2. Alternative proof structure for `ricci_LHS`
3. Permission to defer `ricci_LHS` and proceed with Phase 3.2 (if the alternation proof can work around it)

**Awaiting your direction to proceed.**
