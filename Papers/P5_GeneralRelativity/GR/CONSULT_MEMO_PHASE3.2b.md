## II. Phase 3.2b/c Blocker: ContractionC Structure Mismatch

### The Critical Discovery

Your guidance assumed `ContractionC` was defined as:
```lean
sumIdx (fun k => Γ(k,c,a) * g(k,b)) + sumIdx (fun k => Γ(k,c,b) * g(a,k))
```

**Actual definition (Line 1457-1458):**
```lean
def ContractionC (M r θ : ℝ) (d a b : Idx) : ℝ :=
  sumIdx (fun e => Γtot M r θ e d a * g M e b r θ + Γtot M r θ e d b * g M a e r θ)
```

**Structure:** A **single** `sumIdx` where each summand is the **sum** of two products.

This fundamentally changes the proof strategy - we can't use `congr 1` to split into two separate sums because there's only one sum.

---

## III. Current Proof Attempt (Lines 1807-1841)

### Lemma Statement

```lean
lemma dCoord_ContractionC_expanded (M r θ : ℝ) (μ c a b : Idx) :
  dCoord μ (fun r θ => ContractionC M r θ c a b) r θ =
  sumIdx (fun k =>
    -- First product: ∂_μ(Γ(k,c,a)) · g(k,b) + Γ(k,c,a) · ∂_μ(g(k,b))
    (dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γtot M r θ k c a) r θ * g M k b r θ +
     Γtot M r θ k c a * dCoord μ (fun r θ => g M k b r θ) r θ)
    +
    -- Second product: ∂_μ(Γ(k,c,b)) · g(a,k) + Γ(k,c,b) · ∂_μ(g(a,k))
    (dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γtot M r θ k c b) r θ * g M a k r θ +
     Γtot M r θ k c b * dCoord μ (fun r θ => g M a k r θ) r θ)
  ) := by
```

### Attempted Proof (Current Version)

```lean
  -- 1. Expand definition
  simp only [ContractionC]

  -- Goal after step 1:
  -- dCoord μ (fun r θ => sumIdx (fun e => Γ(...e...) * g(...) + Γ(...e...) * g(...))) r θ
  -- = sumIdx (fun k => [expanded RHS with 4 terms])

  -- 2. Distribute into sum (Linearity: dCoord of sumIdx)
  rw [dCoord_sumIdx]

  -- Goal after step 2:
  -- sumIdx (fun e => dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(...e...) * g(...) + Γ(...e...) * g(...)) r θ)
  -- = sumIdx (fun k => [expanded RHS with 4 terms])

  -- 3. Move inside the sum binder
  congr; ext k

  -- Goal after step 3 (now proving for a fixed k):
  -- dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,a) * g(k,b) + Γ(k,c,b) * g(a,k)) r θ
  -- = [RHS with 4 terms for this k]

  -- 4a. Distribute dCoord over addition inside summand
  rw [dCoord_add_of_diff]

  -- Goal after step 4a:
  -- dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,a) * g(k,b)) r θ
  --   + dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,b) * g(a,k)) r θ
  -- = [RHS with 4 terms]

  -- 4b. Apply Product Rule to both products
  congr 1
  all_goals { rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff] }

  -- THIS IS WHERE IT FAILS
  -- Error: unsolved goals from dCoord_mul_of_diff hypothesis generation
  -- Error: "Tactic `rewrite` failed: Did not find an occurrence of the pattern"

  -- 5. Discharge ALL Differentiability Preconditions
  all_goals (try discharge_diff)
```

### Errors Encountered

**Error 1 (Line 1833):** `unsolved goals`
```
case e_f.h.e_a.hf_r
M r θ : ℝ
μ c a b k : Idx
⊢ DifferentiableAt_r (fun r θ => Γtot M r θ k c a) r θ ∨ μ ≠ Idx.r
```

**Error 2 (Line 1833):** `Tactic 'rewrite' failed: Did not find an occurrence of the pattern`

The issue is that `congr 1` creates two subgoals (one for each addend), but then `all_goals { rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff] }` tries to apply the rewrite to ALL goals including the differentiation hypotheses generated by the first rewrite.

---

## IV. The Tactical Challenge

### Problem Analysis

After `congr 1`, we have 2 goals:
1. `dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,a) * g(k,b)) r θ = [first product expanded]`
2. `dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,b) * g(a,k)) r θ = [second product expanded]`

When we `rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]` on goal 1, it generates 4 differentiability subgoals (hf_r, hg_r, hf_θ, hg_θ).

Now we have 6 goals: main goal 1, 4 hypothesis goals, goal 2.

When `all_goals { rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff] }` continues, it tries to apply the rewrite to the hypothesis goals (which don't match the pattern), causing errors.

### What We Need

A tactical sequence that:
1. Applies `dCoord_mul_of_diff` to both product goals
2. Generates all differentiability hypotheses
3. Discharges all hypotheses with `discharge_diff`
4. Maintains proper goal state throughout

**Question:** What's the correct tactical sequence?

---

## V. Attempted Solutions (All Failed)

### Attempt 1: Bullet Points

```lean
congr 1
· rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]
· rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]
all_goals { try { discharge_diff } }
```

**Result:** Syntax error - bullets not allowed after `congr 1` in this context

### Attempt 2: all_goals with try

```lean
congr 1
all_goals { rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff] }
all_goals { try { discharge_diff } }
```

**Result:** Rewrite fails on hypothesis goals (pattern doesn't match)

### Attempt 3: all_goals with try on rewrite

```lean
congr 1
all_goals { try { rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff] } }
all_goals (try discharge_diff)
```

**Result:** Same - rewrite succeeds on 2 goals, generates hypotheses, then rewrite fails on hypothesis goals

---

## VI. Specific Questions

### Q1: Goal Rotation Strategy?

Should we use `rotate_left`/`rotate_right` to separate the main goals from hypothesis goals?

```lean
congr 1
-- Now have 2 main goals
rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]  -- Apply to first goal, generates 4 hypothesis subgoals
-- Now have 6 goals: goal 1 (done), 4 hypotheses, goal 2
rotate_right 5  -- Move goal 2 to front?
rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]  -- Apply to goal 2
-- Now have 9 goals: 4 hypotheses from first, goal 2 (done), 4 hypotheses from second, goal 1 (done)
rotate_left ...  -- Bring hypotheses to front
all_goals (try discharge_diff)
```

**Is this the right approach?**

---

### Q2: Focus Tactic?

Should we use `focus` to handle each product separately?

```lean
congr 1
· focus
  rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]
  all_goals (try discharge_diff)
· focus
  rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]
  all_goals (try discharge_diff)
```

**Would this work?**

---

### Q3: on_goal Tactic?

Is there a tactic to selectively apply rewrites only to goals matching a pattern?

```lean
congr 1
all_goals {
  try {
    rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]
  }
}
-- Then discharge hypotheses
all_goals (try discharge_diff)
```

**Why does `try` not prevent the rewrite error on hypothesis goals?**

---

### Q4: Different Proof Structure?

Should we avoid `congr 1` entirely and use a different approach?

**Option A:** Manual term construction
```lean
rw [dCoord_add_of_diff]
show dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,a) * g(k,b)) r θ + ... = ...
rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff, dCoord_mul_of_diff]
all_goals (try discharge_diff)
```

**Option B:** Use `calc` mode
```lean
calc dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,a) * g(k,b) + Γ(k,c,b) * g(a,k)) r θ
    = dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,a) * g(k,b)) r θ
        + dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γ(k,c,b) * g(a,k)) r θ := by rw [dCoord_add_of_diff]; all_goals discharge_diff
    _ = ... := by rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff, dCoord_mul_of_diff]; all_goals discharge_diff
```

**Option C:** Prove intermediate helper lemmas
```lean
-- Helper 1
lemma dCoord_product_expanded (μ k c a b) :
  dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γtot M r θ k c a * g M k b r θ) r θ
  = dCoord μ (fun r θ => Γtot M r θ k c a) r θ * g M k b r θ
    + Γtot M r θ k c a * dCoord μ (fun r θ => g M k b r θ) r θ := by
  rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]
  all_goals discharge_diff

-- Then use helper in main proof
rw [dCoord_add_of_diff]
congr 1
· exact dCoord_product_expanded μ k c a b
· exact dCoord_product_expanded μ k c b a  -- With swapped indices
```

**Which approach would you recommend?**

---

## VII. Minimal Working Example of the Issue

```lean
-- Simplified version demonstrating the tactical issue
lemma test_congr_issue (f g : ℝ → ℝ) (x : ℝ)
    (hf : DifferentiableAt ℝ f x)
    (hg : DifferentiableAt ℝ g x) :
    deriv (fun y => f y + g y) x = deriv f x + deriv g x := by
  rw [deriv_add hf hg]
  -- Now suppose we wanted to do this in a way that generates hypotheses:
  -- congr 1
  -- all_goals { try { rw [some_lemma_that_needs_hypotheses] } }
  -- The `try` doesn't help because once the first rewrite succeeds and generates
  -- hypothesis goals, the subsequent rewrite attempts fail on those hypothesis goals.
```

**The core issue:** When a rewrite generates subgoals (hypotheses), and we're using `all_goals`, subsequent tactics apply to both the main goals AND the hypothesis goals, causing pattern match failures.

---

## VIII. Current State Summary

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Infrastructure (Phase 3.2a) complete and building
- ✅ Lemma statement is correct
- ✅ Proof strategy is sound (expand → distribute → apply rules)
- ✅ discharge_diff can handle the hypotheses (when we can get to them)

**What's Blocked:**
- ❌ Goal state management after `congr 1` + `rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]`
- ❌ Tactical sequence to separate main goals from hypothesis goals
- ❌ How to apply rewrites to only matching goals when using `all_goals`

**Impact:**
- alternation_dC_eq_Riem (Phase 3.2d) depends on this structural lemma
- Build currently has ~7 errors (all in dCoord_ContractionC_expanded proof)

---

## IX. What We Need From You

**Primary Request:**

Provide the **exact tactical sequence** for proving `dCoord_ContractionC_expanded`, specifically:

1. **After `rw [dCoord_add_of_diff]`**, we have:
   ```
   dCoord μ (Γ·g) + dCoord μ (Γ·g) = [RHS with 4 terms]
   ```
   How do we apply `dCoord_mul_of_diff` to both products AND discharge their hypotheses correctly?

2. **Should we use:**
   - `focus` blocks?
   - `rotate_left`/`rotate_right`?
   - Helper lemmas (Option C)?
   - `calc` mode?
   - Something else?

3. **Concrete example:** What should lines 1831-1841 be?

---

## X. Proposed Alternatives (If Tactical Complexity Too High)

If the tactical sequence for the structural lemma is too complex, we have two alternatives:

**Alternative A: Simplify the Lemma**

Instead of fully expanding, prove a weaker version:
```lean
lemma dCoord_ContractionC_sum_form (M r θ : ℝ) (μ c a b : Idx) :
  dCoord μ (fun r θ => ContractionC M r θ c a b) r θ =
  sumIdx (fun k => dCoord μ (fun r θ =>
    Γtot M r θ k c a * g M k b r θ + Γtot M r θ k c b * g M a k r θ) r θ) := by
  simp only [ContractionC]
  rw [dCoord_sumIdx]
  all_goals discharge_diff
```

Then prove product expansions separately as needed.

**Alternative B: Defer to sorry**

Use `sorry` for `dCoord_ContractionC_expanded` and prove `alternation_dC_eq_Riem` directly with more manual expansion.

**Would you prefer we pursue one of these alternatives?**

---

## XI. Conclusion

Phase 3.2a infrastructure is solid. The blocker is purely tactical - we have all the right lemmas and the proof strategy is correct, but we need the precise tactical sequence to manage goal state when applying rewrites that generate hypotheses within `congr 1` + `all_goals` context.

**Awaiting your tactical guidance for Phase 3.2b/c.**
