# Session Progress Summary: October 1, 2025

**Build:** ✅ PASSING (3078 jobs, 0 errors)
**Sorries:** 7 total (5 original + 2 new C3 stubs)

---

## Executive Summary

**Objective:** Reduce 5 remaining sorries to 0 (TRUE LEVEL 3) per Professor's MEMORANDUM

**Progress:**
- ✅ Path B (discharge_diff enhancement): PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ✅ Path A (C3 smoothness): INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE
- ⚠️ Both paths require additional professor guidance to complete

**Key Finding:** Both paths hit complexity requiring advanced Lean/mathlib expertise beyond current capability

---

## Path B: Enhanced discharge_diff Tactic

### What Works ✅

**Enhanced Strategy 2 (lines 597-642):**
```lean
-- Strategy 2: Base Facts (Explicit Application) - THE KEY ENHANCEMENT
| { apply Γtot_differentiable_r <;> try assumption }
| { apply Γtot_differentiable_θ <;> try assumption }
| { apply g_differentiable_r <;> try assumption }
| { apply g_differentiable_θ <;> try assumption }
```

Successfully replaced `simp only` approach with explicit `apply` + `<;> try assumption`.

**Validation:** hF_r and hF_θ hypotheses for `dCoord_ContractionC_expanded` build successfully (30+ lines of explicit proof, lines 1983-2000).

### What's Blocked ⚠️

**Nested Hypothesis Discharge:**
After `rw [dCoord_sumIdx]`, need 12 additional hypotheses for:
- `rw [dCoord_add_of_diff]` → 4 hypotheses
- `rw [dCoord_mul_of_diff]` (×2) → 8 hypotheses

**Issue:** `discharge_diff` recursion doesn't properly handle nested contexts. Attempts with `all_goals { first | exact Or.inl (...) }` hit type mismatches.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- Tactic scoping issues in focused proof blocks (`·`)
- Variable shadowing (lemma parameter `k` vs bound variable `k`)
- `first` combinator not matching correctly in nested `all_goals` contexts

**Documentation:** `TACTICAL_STATUS_DISCHARGE_DIFF.md` (full analysis)

## Path A: C3 Smoothness Infrastructure

### What's Implemented ✅

**Import Added (line 12-13):**
```lean
import Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.ContDiff.Defs
import Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.ContDiff.Basic
```

**C3 Lemmas Stubbed (lines 289-319):**
1. `differentiableAt_deriv_f` - f'(r) = 2M/r² is differentiable (sorry at line 312)
2. `differentiableAt_deriv_sin_sq` - (sin²θ)' is differentiable (sorry at line 319)

**Mathematical Content (documented in comments):**
- f(r) = 1 - 2M/r → f'(r) = 2M/r² → f''(r) = -4M/r³ ✓
- sin²θ → (sin²θ)' = 2·sin·cos = sin(2θ) → (sin²θ)'' = 2·cos(2θ) ✓

### What's Blocked ⚠️

**ContDiffAt Approach Issues:**
- Initial attempt used `ContDiffAt.differentiableAt` with named argument `m` → Invalid argument error
- Mathlib's ContDiffAt machinery is more complex than anticipated
- Bridge lemma `differentiableAt_deriv_of_contDiffAt` requires iteratedFDeriv understanding

**Direct Proof Approach:**
- Need specific mathlib lemmas for:
  - `deriv (fun r => 2*M/r²)` computation
  - Second derivative existence from composition rules
- Complexity: Requires deep knowledge of Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.Deriv hierarchy

## Current Sorry Breakdown

### Critical Path (Blocks main theorem)
1. **dCoord_ContractionC_expanded** (line 1987)
   - **Blocker:** discharge_diff nested hypothesis discharge
   - **Partial Work:** hF_r/hF_θ validated (30+ lines proven)
   - **Remaining:** 12 hypothesis discharges for product rules

2. **alternation_dC_eq_Riem** (line ~1995)
   - **Depends On:** dCoord_ContractionC_expanded
   - **Status:** Blocked by #1

### C3 Path (Unblocks 2 lemmas)
3. **differentiableAt_deriv_f** (line 312) - NEW STUB
   - **Blocker:** Direct deriv calculation or ContDiffAt bridge
   - **Mathematical:** f''(r) = -4M/r³ exists (trivial mathematically)

4. **differentiableAt_deriv_sin_sq** (line 319) - NEW STUB
   - **Blocker:** Direct deriv calculation or ContDiffAt bridge
   - **Mathematical:** (sin²θ)'' = 2·cos(2θ) exists (trivial mathematically)

### Dependent on C3
5. **dCoord_g_differentiable_r** (line ~1537)
   - **Depends On:** differentiableAt_deriv_f (#3)
   - **Cases:** Most trivial (dCoord of constant = 0), μ=r + g=g_tt/g_rr need C3

6. **dCoord_g_differentiable_θ** (line ~1552)
   - **Depends On:** differentiableAt_deriv_sin_sq (#4)
   - **Cases:** Most trivial, μ=θ + g=g_φφ needs C3

### Auxiliary
7. **dCoord_sumIdx_via_funext** (line 798)
   - **Status:** May not be on critical path
   - **Action:** Assess necessity, delete if redundant

## Recommendations

### SHORT TERM: Request Professor Guidance

**Path B Question:**
> "The enhanced `discharge_diff` tactic successfully applies C1 lemmas with explicit `apply` + `<;> try assumption`. However, in nested contexts (after `rw [dCoord_sumIdx]` → `congr; funext k` → `rw [dCoord_add_of_diff]`), the tactic doesn't properly discharge hypotheses. How should we handle hypothesis discharge in nested focused proof blocks? Is there a Lean 4 tactic scoping pattern we're missing?"

**Path A Question:**
> "We need to prove `DifferentiableAt ℝ (deriv f) r` where `f r = 1 - 2M/r` and `r ≠ 0`. Mathematically, f'(r) = 2M/r² and f''(r) = -4M/r³ both exist. We tried:
> 1. ContDiffAt approach → hit complexity with `ContDiffAt.differentiableAt` signature
> 2. Direct deriv composition → type inference issues
>
> What's the standard mathlib pattern for proving second-order differentiability of rational functions?"

### MEDIUM TERM: Implementation Strategy

**If Path A Unblocks First:**
1. Complete differentiableAt_deriv_f and differentiableAt_deriv_sin_sq
2. Complete dCoord_g_differentiable_r/θ (2 sorries eliminated)
3. Return to Path B with fresh perspective

**If Path B Unblocks First:**
1. Complete dCoord_ContractionC_expanded
2. Complete alternation_dC_eq_Riem (critical path done!)
3. Return to Path A for remaining 2 C3 lemmas

### FALLBACK: Manual Discharge

If tactical fixes prove too complex:
- Option: Complete dCoord_ContractionC_expanded with explicit 62-line hypothesis discharge
- Pro: Guarantees progress on critical path
- Con: Not reusable, high maintenance burden
