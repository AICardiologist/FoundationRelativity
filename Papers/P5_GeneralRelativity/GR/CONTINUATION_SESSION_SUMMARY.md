# Continuation Session Summary: October 1, 2025

## Session Goal
Reduce 5 remaining sorries to 0 (TRUE LEVEL 3)

## Approach Taken
Attempted **Option C**: Prove C3 smoothness base facts first (easier path)

---

## Work Completed

### 1. dCoord_ContractionC_expanded Investigation ✅
**Result:** Proof strategy VALIDATED, tactical blocker DOCUMENTED

- Successfully constructed `hF_r` and `hF_θ` hypotheses (30+ lines of working proof)
- Identified root cause: `discharge_diff` tactic doesn't pass hypothesis parameters
- Created comprehensive documentation: `DCCOORD_CONTRACTION_APPROACH.md`
- Decision: Keep sorry, recommend tactical infrastructure enhancement

### 2. C3 Smoothness Attempt ⚠️
**Result:** Added stub lemma, encountered mathlib complexity

**Added Lemma:**
```lean
lemma differentiableAt_deriv_f (M r : ℝ) (h_ext : Exterior M r 0) :
    DifferentiableAt ℝ (deriv (fun r' => f M r')) r := by
  sorry
```

**Technical Challenge:**
- Need to prove: derivative of `f(r) = 1 - 2M/r` is itself differentiable
- `f'(r) = 2M/r²` → need to show this is differentiable
- Attempted using `deriv_sub`, `deriv_const_mul`, `DifferentiableAt.inv`
- Hit type mismatch errors with mathlib's deriv infrastructure
- Complexity higher than anticipated (requires deep understanding of Lean 4's calc library)

**Mathematical Fact** (trivial in classical analysis):
- f(r) = 1 - 2M/r
- f'(r) = 2M/r²
- f''(r) = -4M/r³ (exists when r ≠ 0, which holds in Exterior domain)

**Why It's Hard in Lean:**
- Need to work with `deriv` function from mathlib
- Need correct lemma applications for `deriv_sub`, `deriv_const_mul`, etc.
- Type inference issues with higher-order differentiability
- Mathlib may have `ContDiff` or `IteratedDeriv` infrastructure that would be cleaner

---

## Current State

**Build:** ✅ PASSING (3078 jobs, 0 errors)
**Sorries:** 6 (5 original + 1 new stub for differentiableAt_deriv_f)

### Sorry Breakdown
1. `dCoord_ContractionC_expanded` - Tactical blocker (discharge_diff)
2. `dCoord_g_differentiable_r` - Needs C3 for f (blocked on differentiableAt_deriv_f)
3. `dCoord_g_differentiable_θ` - Needs C3 for sin²θ
4. `alternation_dC_eq_Riem` - Blocked on #1
5. `dCoord_sumIdx_via_funext` - Auxiliary (may not be needed)
6. `differentiableAt_deriv_f` - NEW: C3 base fact for f (mathlib complexity)

---

## Key Findings

### 1. C3 Smoothness is Non-Trivial in Lean
While mathematically obvious that `f(r) = 1-2M/r` is infinitely differentiable for r ≠ 0, proving this formally requires:
- Understanding mathlib's `deriv` infrastructure
- Correct sequencing of `deriv_*` lemmas
- Potentially using `ContDiff` (continuous differentiability) instead of iterating `DifferentiableAt`

### 2. Two Viable Paths Forward

**Path A: Master mathlib deriv Infrastructure**
- Learn `ContDiff`, `IteratedDeriv`, or related machinery
- May have lemmas like `ContDiff.inv` that handle r⁻¹ cleanly
- Complexity: Medium-High (requires mathlib expertise)
- Impact: Enables C3 proofs, unblocks 2 sorries

**Path B: Enhance discharge_diff Tactic**
- More architectural, affects multiple proofs
- Complexity: Medium (requires Lean 4 macro knowledge)
- Impact: Unblocks 1 sorry immediately, benefits future proofs

### 3. Both Paths Require Deeper Technical Knowledge
- **Path A:** Mathlib calculus infrastructure (ContDiff, deriv composition rules)
- **Path B:** Lean 4 meta-programming and tactic design

Neither is a "quick win" - both require dedicated learning/research time.

---

## Recommendations

### For Next Session

**SHORT TERM:**
1. **Consult Professor** on either:
   - How to prove C3 base facts in Lean 4 (Path A guidance)
   - How to enhance discharge_diff tactic (Path B tactical pattern)

2. **Alternative:** Research mathlib documentation for:
   - `ContDiff` and related lemmas
   - Examples of proving higher-order differentiability for rational functions

**MEDIUM TERM:**
- Once either path is unblocked, the remaining sorries should fall quickly
- alternation_dC_eq_Riem depends on dCoord_ContractionC_expanded (Path B blocker)
- dCoord_g_differentiable_r/θ depend on C3 facts (Path A blocker)

### Strategic Assessment

**Current Progress:** 67% sorry reduction (15 → 5 core sorries)
**Remaining Difficulty:** High (both paths require advanced Lean/mathlib knowledge)
**Estimated Time to TRUE LEVEL 3:**
- With professor guidance: 1-2 sessions
- Without guidance: 3-5 sessions (learning mathlib + meta-programming)

## Documentation Created This Session

1. ✅ `DCCOORD_CONTRACTION_APPROACH.md` - dCoord_ContractionC_expanded analysis
2. ✅ `SESSION_STATUS.md` - Updated with continuation findings
3. ✅ `CONTINUATION_SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

---

## Code Changes

**Added:**
- `differentiableAt_deriv_f` stub (line 290) - C3 base fact placeholder

**Status:** All changes committed, build passing

---

## Conclusion

This session validated that both remaining paths (C3 smoothness and discharge_diff enhancement) require deeper technical expertise than initially estimated. The mathematical content is trivial, but the formal infrastructure is non-trivial.

**Next Step:** Request professor guidance on preferred path and tactical patterns.
