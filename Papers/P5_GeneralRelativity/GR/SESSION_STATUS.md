# Session Status: October 1, 2025 - Continuation Session

## Current State
- **Build:** ✅ PASSING (3078 jobs, 0 errors)
- **Sorry Count:** 5 (down from 15 at original session start, after Hypothesis Management complete)
- **Phase:** Post-Hypothesis Management - Tactical Refinement Phase

---

## Session Timeline

### Original Session: Hypothesis Management & 10 Lemma Proofs
**Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Hypothesis Management refactoring COMPLETE (all C1/C2 signatures updated)
- ✅ Γtot_differentiable_r/θ FULLY PROVEN (128 cases total, 0 sorries)
- ✅ g_differentiable_r/θ FULLY PROVEN (32 cases total, 0 sorries)
- ✅ ContractionC_differentiable_r/θ FULLY PROVEN (0 sorries)
- ✅ Infrastructure lemmas updated (ricci_LHS, ricci_identity_on_g, Riemann_*_ext)
- **Progress:** 15 → 5 sorries (67% reduction)
- **Git:** Committed as "feat(P5/GR): Complete Hypothesis Management cascade - 10 lemmas proven"

### Continuation Session: dCoord_ContractionC_expanded Investigation
**Goal:** Reduce 5 remaining sorries to 0 (TRUE LEVEL 3)

**Work Done:**
1. ✅ Analyzed dCoord_ContractionC_expanded tactical blocker
2. ✅ Validated proof strategy (successfully constructed hF_r and hF_θ hypotheses)
3. ✅ Identified root cause: discharge_diff tactic doesn't pass hypotheses to C1 lemmas
4. ✅ Attempted manual hypothesis discharge (30+ lines working, 30+ lines blocked on unification errors)
5. ✅ Documented findings in DCCOORD_CONTRACTION_APPROACH.md

**Decision:** Keep sorry, recommend tactical infrastructure enhancement (see DCCOORD_CONTRACTION_APPROACH.md)

## Current Sorries (5 Total)

### Category A: Tactical Blockers (3 sorries)

#### 1. dCoord_ContractionC_expanded (Line ~1967)
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED on tactical complexity
**Dependencies:** ✅ ALL SATISFIED (C1 lemmas proven, hypotheses in scope)
**Blocker:** Requires 14 hypothesis discharges; discharge_diff tactic doesn't pass hypotheses correctly
**Solution:** Enhance discharge_diff OR complete 62-line manual discharge (partially implemented but hit unification errors)
**Documentation:** See DCCOORD_CONTRACTION_APPROACH.md for full analysis

#### 2. dCoord_g_differentiable_r (Line ~1537)
**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS C3 SMOOTHNESS
**Blocker:** Most cases trivial (dCoord of constant = 0), but μ=r + g=g_tt/g_rr need ∂_r(∂_r(f))
**Required:** Prove twice-differentiability of f(r) = 1-2M/r in Exterior domain

#### 3. dCoord_g_differentiable_θ (Line ~1552)
**Status:** ⏳ NEEDS C3 SMOOTHNESS
**Blocker:** Most cases trivial, but μ=θ + g=g_φφ needs ∂_θ(∂_θ(sin²θ))
**Required:** Prove twice-differentiability of sin²θ

---

### Category B: Main Theorem (1 sorry)

#### 4. alternation_dC_eq_Riem (Line ~1991)
**Status:** ⏳ BLOCKED on dCoord_ContractionC_expanded
**Dependencies:**
- ❌ dCoord_ContractionC_expanded (needed for structural rewrite)
- ✅ All other infrastructure ready
**Remaining Work:** Algebraic normalization after structural rewrites
**Estimate:** Should be straightforward once dCoord_ContractionC_expanded is proven

---

### Category C: Auxiliary (1 sorry)

#### 5. dCoord_sumIdx_via_funext (Line ~785)
**Status:** ❓ UNCLEAR if on critical path
**Analysis Needed:** Determine if required for alternation_dC_eq_Riem or other critical lemmas

---

## Proof Strategy Assessment

### ✅ What's Proven Sound
1. **Definition Localization Pattern** for Christoffel symbols (Γtot) - VALIDATED, 128 cases proven
2. **Manual 4-term expansion** for ContractionC - VALIDATED, proven
3. **Hypothesis Management** with physical domain constraints - VALIDATED, all cascading works
4. **Sequential Rewrite Strategy** for dCoord_ContractionC_expanded - VALIDATED (hF_r/hF_θ successfully constructed)

### ⚠️ What's Blocked
1. **discharge_diff tactic** doesn't handle hypothesis parameters for C1 lemmas
2. **Manual hypothesis discharge** hits unification errors after 50% completion (see lines 2005-2037 in attempted implementation)
3. **C3 smoothness base facts** not yet proven (needed for dCoord_g lemmas)

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### SHORT TERM (Next Session)
**Option A:** Enhance discharge_diff tactic (RECOMMENDED)
- Modify lines 591-629 to explicitly pass hypotheses when applying C1 lemmas
- Impact: Unblocks dCoord_ContractionC_expanded and all similar future proofs
- Complexity: Moderate (requires Lean 4 macro knowledge)

**Option B:** Complete manual discharge for dCoord_ContractionC_expanded
- Debug unification errors in lines 2005-2037 of attempted implementation
- Impact: Only fixes this one lemma
- Complexity: High (62+ lines of repetitive tactics)

**Option C:** Prove C3 base facts first
- May be easier wins: `differentiableAt_deriv_f_r`, `differentiableAt_deriv_sin_sq_θ`
- Impact: Unblocks 2 sorries (dCoord_g_differentiable_r/θ)
- Complexity: Moderate (depends on mathlib coverage)

### MEDIUM TERM
- After unblocking dCoord_ContractionC_expanded: Complete alternation_dC_eq_Riem (likely straightforward)
- Assess whether dCoord_sumIdx_via_funext is actually needed

### LONG TERM
- Document proof patterns for future papers
- Consider refactoring Condition Localization if it continues to cause issues

## File Organization

**Status Documents:**
- `SESSION_STATUS.md` - This file (current state and next steps)
- `DCCOORD_CONTRACTION_APPROACH.md` - Detailed analysis of dCoord_ContractionC_expanded blocker

**Historical Memos:**
- `CONSULT_MEMO_9.md` - Original questions to professor (15 sorries state)
- `CONSULT_MEMO_10_RESPONSE.md` - Professor's MEMORANDUM with tactical guidance
- `SENIOR_PROF_TACTICAL_PLAN.md` - High-level roadmap

**Main Code:**
- `Riemann.lean` - All formalization (✅ build passing, 5 sorries)

## Success Metrics

**Original Goal:** TRUE LEVEL 3 (Zero Sorries)
**Current Progress:**
- ✅ 67% sorry reduction (15 → 5)
- ✅ 10 major lemmas FULLY PROVEN (160 total cases)
- ✅ Build: PASSING with 0 errors
- ⏳ 5 sorries remaining (3 tactical, 1 theorem, 1 auxiliary)

**Remaining Work:**
- Critical Path: Fix discharge_diff OR manually complete dCoord_ContractionC_expanded
- Then: alternation_dC_eq_Riem should follow quickly
- Nice-to-have: C3 base facts for dCoord_g lemmas
