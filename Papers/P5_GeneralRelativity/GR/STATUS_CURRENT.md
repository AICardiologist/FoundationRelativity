# Current Status: TRUE LEVEL 3 Implementation

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Time:** ~2.5 hours invested
**Build Errors:** 23 remaining (down from ~40)

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Priority 1: COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Deleted Stage2_mu_t_preview namespace
- ‚úÖ 1 sorry eliminated

### Priority 2: 60% COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Deleted 3 legacy lemmas (dCoord_add/sub/mul) - 3 sorries eliminated
- ‚úÖ Fixed syntax error (line 705)
- ‚úÖ Refactored dCoord_add4 proof (lines 722-730)
- ‚úÖ Refactored dCoord_sum Idx proof (lines 796-802)
- ‚úÖ Refactored dCoord_add4_flat signature (lines 733-745)
- ‚úÖ Fixed simp calls (lines 936, 1476)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Work (40% of Priority 2)

### Build Errors: 23 total

**Categories:**
1. **Type mismatches** from dCoord_add4/dCoord_sumIdx needing differentiability proofs (~8 errors)
2. **Unknown identifier dCoord_mul** (~8 errors)
3. **Unknown identifier dCoord_add** in Stage1 lemmas (~6 errors)
4. **Other cascading errors** (~1 error)

**Estimated time:** 1.5-2 hours

---

## Strategy for Remaining Errors

The remaining 23 errors fall into systematic patterns that can be fixed with the professor's "Automated Hypothesis Discharge" pattern:

```lean
apply dCoord_mul_of_diff
all_goals {
  try { discharge_diff }  -- Prove differentiability
  try { simp }            -- Prove direction mismatch
}
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix ~8 dCoord_mul uses ‚Üí dCoord_mul_of_diff
2. Fix ~8 type mismatches with hypothesis discharge
3. Fix ~6 dCoord_add uses in Stage1 lemmas
4. Test build
5. Iterate on any remaining errors

## Sorry Count Progress

| Milestone | Sorries | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Initial | 5 active | ‚è∫ Starting point |
| After Priority 1 | 4 active | ‚úÖ Stage2 deleted |
| After Priority 2 | 1 active | ‚ö†Ô∏è 60% complete |
| After Priority 3 | 0 | üéØ TRUE LEVEL 3 |

**Current:** 1 sorry remaining (line 2010 - Riemann_alternation)

---

## Time Estimates

**Invested:** 2.5 hours
**Remaining:**
- Finish Priority 2: 1.5-2 hours
- Priority 3 (alternation): 4-8 hours

**Total to TRUE LEVEL 3:** 6-10.5 hours from now

---

## Decision Point

**Option 1:** Continue systematic refactoring (1.5-2 hours to finish Priority 2)
- Pro: Clear path, professor's patterns work
- Con: Time investment required

**Option 2:** Checkpoint and document current state
- Pro: 4 out of 5 sorries eliminated
- Con: Build failing, incomplete

**Option 3:** Focus on just getting build passing, defer perfect proofs
- Pro: Faster to working state
- Con: May still have some admitted lemmas

---

**Recommendation:** Continue with Option 1 - we're 60% through Priority 2, systematic patterns are working, clear path to completion.

The professor's guidance is solid and the refactoring is progressing well. The remaining 23 errors are systematic and can be resolved with the established patterns.

**Next immediate action:** Fix dCoord_mul uses with dCoord_mul_of_diff + discharge_diff pattern
