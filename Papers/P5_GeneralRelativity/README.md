### Key Lean Concepts

#### Height Profiles
```lean
structure AxisProfile where
  hChoice : Height    -- AC/DCω axis
  hComp   : Height    -- FT/WKL₀ axis  
  hLogic  : Height    -- LEM/WLPO/MP axis
```

#### Portal Framework
```lean
inductive PortalFlag
| uses_zorn         -- Zorn's lemma application
| uses_limit_curve  -- Ascoli-Arzelà / curve compactness
| uses_serial_chain -- Infinite dependent choice construction
| uses_reductio     -- Essential proof by contradiction
```

#### Witness Families
```lean
def WitnessFamily := Foundation → Prop

def G1_Vacuum_W : WitnessFamily := fun F =>
  ∀ (Ssch : Spacetime), IsPinnedSchwarzschild Ssch → VacuumEFE Ssch
```

## 📋 Sprint 3 Achievement: Schwarzschild Vacuum Solution

**Complete symbolic verification** of the Schwarzschild metric as a solution to Einstein's vacuum field equations:

### Christoffel Symbols Computed
All 40 potentially non-zero symbols evaluated, with 9 non-vanishing:
- **Radial-temporal**: Γ^t_{tr} = M/(r²f), Γ^r_{tt} = Mf/r², Γ^r_{rr} = -M/(r²f)
- **Radial-angular**: Γ^r_{θθ} = -r+2M, Γ^r_{φφ} = -(r-2M)sin²θ
- **Angular mixing**: Γ^θ_{rθ} = 1/r, Γ^θ_{φφ} = -sinθ cosθ, Γ^φ_{rφ} = 1/r, Γ^φ_{θφ} = cotθ

### Ricci Tensor Vanishing
Complete computation via R_{μν} = ∂_ρ Γ^ρ_{μν} - ∂_ν Γ^ρ_{μρ} + Γ^ρ_{ρσ} Γ^σ_{μν} - Γ^ρ_{νσ} Γ^σ_{μρ}:
- **Diagonal components**: R_{tt} = R_{rr} = R_{θθ} = R_{φφ} = 0 ✅
- **Off-diagonal**: All vanish by spherical symmetry ✅
- **Key identity used**: cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ for final algebraic closure

## 🔬 Hybrid Development Plan

**Schematic Map (Current)**: 
- Register all G1-G5 witness families ✅
- Attach route flags per standard proofs ✅  
- Emit HeightCertificates using portal soundness ✅
- Maintain verification ledger with citations ✅

**Deep Dive (Deliverables)**:

- **D2**: Schwarzschild vacuum solution (Height 0) ✅ **[Sprint 3 Complete]**
  - Full symbolic tensor computation framework
  - All Christoffel symbols and Ricci components
  - Verified R_{μν} = 0 for f(r) = 1 - 2M/r

## 📚 Literature Integration

The portal framework integrates key literature at the axiom level:

- **Robb/Reichenbach/EPS**: Axiomatic kinematics → no portals for conformal/projective recovery
- **Pour-El-Richards**: Computable→non-computable PDE evolution → Logic axis calibration
- **Bishop-Bridges/Hellman**: Constructive analysis guidance → Height 0 vs choice distinction
- **Wald/Hawking-Ellis/Choquet-Bruhat**: Standard GR proofs → portal location identification

## 🎯 Success Metrics

1. ✅ **D1 and D2 compiled without `sorry`**
2. ✅ **HeightCertificates present for all G1-G5** 
3. ✅ **Explicit portal flags in ledger**
4. ✅ **CI and verification infrastructure**

## 🔗 Integration with AxCal Ecosystem

Paper 5 builds on the complete frozen AxCal framework:
- **Paper 3A**: Three orthogonal axes and uniformization theory
- **Paper 3B**: Proof-theoretic scaffold and collision framework  
- **Paper 4**: Spectral geometry calibrations and profile algebra
- **Papers 1-2**: Foundational results in functional analysis

The GR calibration extends AxCal methodology to spacetime physics while maintaining the same rigorous approach to axiom accounting.

*This paper demonstrates that GR's logical complexity can be mapped precisely through AxCal portals, separating constructive geometry (Height 0) from choice-dependent existence results and measurement theory.*
