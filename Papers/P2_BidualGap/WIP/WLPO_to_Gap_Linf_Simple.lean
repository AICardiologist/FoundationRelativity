  Option B scaffold: From a nonzero functional on (ℓ∞ / c₀) to a bidual gap for ℓ∞.
  
  Simplified version that compiles with current setup.
  
  Key contribution: Isolates the assumption that WLPO provides (existence of a 
  nonzero functional on ℓ∞/c₀) from the functional-analytic bridge to the gap.

/-! ### The key assumption we need from WLPO

This typeclass encapsulates what WLPO needs to provide: a nonzero functional
on the quotient ℓ∞/c₀.

class HasNonzeroQuotFunctional : Prop :=
  (exists_nonzero : ∃ (X : Type*) [NormedAddCommGroup X] [NormedSpace ℝ X]
    (c₀_sub : Submodule ℝ X) (Φ : (X ⧸ c₀_sub) →L[ℝ] ℝ), Φ ≠ 0)

/-! ### Bridge from quotient functional to bidual gap

The key theorem: if there exists a nonzero functional on some quotient X/Y where
Y is a closed subspace of X, then X has a bidual gap.

This is the reusable, WLPO-independent part.

/-- Abstract version of the bridge lemma.
    Given a Banach space X with a closed subspace Y such that there exists a 
    nonzero functional on X/Y, we get a bidual gap for X. -/

  -- The proof strategy:
  -- 1. Pull back Φ to get f : X → ℝ with f ≠ 0 and f|_Y = 0
  -- 2. Use f to construct a bidual element not in the canonical range
  
  -- For now, we postulate this bridge lemma
  -- The full proof requires the dual exact sequence machinery

/-! ### Main theorem: from the typeclass to a gap -/

/-- If we have a nonzero quotient functional (provided by WLPO), 
    then we get a bidual gap. -/
theorem wlpo_implies_gap_abstract [HasNonzeroQuotFunctional] :
  ∃ (X : Type*) [NormedAddCommGroup X] [NormedSpace ℝ X],
    ∃ G : (X →L[ℝ] ℝ) →L[ℝ] ℝ, 
      ∀ x : X, G ≠ ContinuousLinearMap.evalCLM ℝ X x := by
  -- Unpack the typeclass assumption
  obtain ⟨X, hX1, hX2, Y, Φ, hΦ⟩ := HasNonzeroQuotFunctional.exists_nonzero
  -- Apply the bridge lemma
  use X, hX1, hX2
  -- We need Y to be closed for the bridge to work
  -- In the ℓ∞/c₀ case, c₀ is indeed closed
  sorry -- apply Bridge.abstract_quotient_to_gap Y Φ hΦ

/-! ### Connection to Paper 2's specific case

When we specialize X = ℓ∞ and Y = c₀, we get the specific gap for ℓ∞.
The WLPO construction will provide the instance of HasNonzeroQuotFunctional
for this specific case.

    (G : (ℓ∞ →L[ℝ] ℝ) →L[ℝ] ℝ), 
    ∀ x : ℓ∞, G ≠ ContinuousLinearMap.evalCLM ℝ ℓ∞ x

/-- The specific theorem for ℓ∞ -/
theorem wlpo_implies_gap_linf [HasNonzeroQuotFunctional] : GapLinf := by
  obtain ⟨X, hX1, hX2, G, hG⟩ := wlpo_implies_gap_abstract
  exact ⟨X, hX1, hX2, G, hG⟩

Usage notes:
============
1. The WLPO construction (to be added) will provide:
   instance : HasNonzeroQuotFunctional := ⟨ℓ∞, _, _, c₀, Φ_from_WLPO, proof_Φ_ne_0⟩

2. Once that instance is available, `wlpo_implies_gap_linf` gives the gap immediately.

3. The bridge lemma `abstract_quotient_to_gap` is the key functional-analytic content
   that doesn't depend on WLPO or any logical assumptions.
