  - **Dependency**: Foundation CReal.add_le (successfully implemented in Basic.lean)
  
  **RC.dist_pointwise (line 449)**:
  - **Nature**: Technical extraction lemma for converting quotient bounds to pointwise bounds

  - `h_precision` (line 142) - RC-level precision conversion  
  - `h_triangle composition` (line 144) - Final triangulation combination
- **Roadmap Status**: Phase 2 implementation (Weeks 4-8) - complete constructive framework
- **Approach**: All represent validated Senior Professor regularization technique steps

## Summary Analysis Results

| File | Necessity | Sorry Count | Nature | Attempts Made | Roadmap Status |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|----------------|  
| Basic.lean | Essential stub | 2 | Placeholder definitions | None - explicit QA replacement | Immediate (Weeks 1-2) |
| WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean | Essential stub | 4 | Main theorem placeholders | None - explicit QA replacement | Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4) |  
| CReal/Quotient.lean | Essential | 3 | Senior Professor collaboration | **Extensive - validated approaches** | Foundation-dependent |
| CReal/Completeness.lean | Essential | 6 | Technical implementation | Senior Professor regularization | Phase 2 (Weeks 4-8) |
| **Total** | **All necessary** | **15** | **Mixed** | **Major efforts on foundations** | **Multi-phase plan** |

## Implementation History & Planning

### **Major Attempts Made**:
1. **Senior Professor Collaboration** (August 2025): Comprehensive mathematical validation and implementation attempts on foundation lemmas with detailed tactical documentation
2. **QA Corrective Action** (PR #77): Replaced Unit tricks with honest sorries per roadmap  
3. **Foundation-First Strategy**: Successfully implemented CReal.add_le using precision-shifting technique
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All attempts and barriers thoroughly documented in code

### **Original Roadmap Planning** (from roadmap-corrective-action.md):
- **Paper 2 Timeline**: Weeks 4-8 complete implementation from scratch
- **Required Work**: 4-6 weeks complete implementation  
- **Missing Components**: Bidual space definitions, Goldstine theorem, weak* topology, WLPO equivalence
- **External Consultants**: Functional analyst (2 weeks), Constructive logic expert (1 week)

### **Current Status**:
- **Foundation Infrastructure**: Partially complete with validated mathematical approaches
- **Technical Barriers**: Environment-specific issues identified and documented
- **Implementation Readiness**: Ready for systematic implementation following corrective action roadmap
- **Documentation**: Complete collaboration history preserved for future reference

## Technical Classification

### **Fundamental & Easy (Priority 1)**:
- Basic.lean definitions (2 sorries) - Pure definition replacement
- WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean structure (4 sorries) - Standard theorem framework

### **Technical Implementation (Priority 2)**: 
- Completeness.lean infrastructure (6 sorries) - Validated approach, technical steps

### **Infrastructure-Dependent (Priority 3)**:
- Quotient.lean foundation lemmas (3 sorries) - Requires environment resolution or alternative tactics

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Focus**: Complete Basic.lean and WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean definitions (6 sorries)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Completeness.lean technical steps (6 sorries) 
3. **Infrastructure**: Resolve Quotient.lean environment barriers (3 sorries)
4. **External Support**: Engage functional analyst and constructive logic expert as planned
