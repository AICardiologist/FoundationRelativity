# Final Implementation Status: unit_bound Proof Complete

## Major Achievement
Successfully implemented the complete unit_bound proof from the user's drop-in code, eliminating 5 sorries in the core opNorm_le_tsum_abs_coeff theorem.

## Compilation Status
- **File compiles**: âœ… Yes (with warnings only)  
- **Sorry count**: Reduced from 16 â†’ 8 â†’ **3** ðŸŽ‰
- **Errors**: 0

## Successfully Implemented Proofs

### âœ… Complete unit_bound proof (Lines 543-641)
The entire unit_bound proof now works without sorries:
- Finite-step bound using triangle inequality and norm_sum_le
- Convergence proof using finite_large_coords and vanishing at infinity
- Limit passing with le_of_tendsto_of_tendsto'

### âœ… Normalization step (Lines 737-738)
```lean
rw [norm_smul, norm_inv, norm_norm, inv_mul_cancel hx]
```

### âœ… Rescaling step (Lines 741-747)
```lean
calc â€–f xâ€– = â€–f (â€–xâ€– â€¢ y)â€– := ...
         _ = â€–â€–xâ€– â€¢ f yâ€– := by rw [map_smul]
         _ = â€–xâ€– * â€–f yâ€– := by simp [norm_smul]
         _ â‰¤ â€–xâ€– * S := mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left this (norm_nonneg _)
```

### âœ… precompDual definition (Lines 1352-1368)
Complete LinearIsometryEquiv with all required fields.

### âœ… DualIsBanach.congr (Lines 1371-1387)
Implemented with completeSpace_of_isometricSMul_symm approach.

### âœ… Simplified lp_norm_p1 (Lines 1118-1121)
```lean
simpa [lp.norm_def, Real.rpow_one]
```

## Remaining Sorries (Only 3!)

All remaining sorries are in the WLPO section:
1. Line 1419: `WLPO_implies_SCNP_l1`
2. Line 1424: `SCNP_implies_complete`  
3. Line 1433: Transport completeness API fallback

## Key Technical Details

The unit_bound proof now includes:
- Proper use of `norm_sum_le` for triangle inequality
- Coordinate extraction using classical reasoning and simp
- Sup-norm bounds via `ZeroAtInftyContinuousMap.norm_le`
- Proper limit passing with `le_of_tendsto_of_tendsto'`

## Summary
The implementation is essentially complete for the main dual isometry theorem. The core mathematical content (opNorm_le_tsum_abs_coeff and opNorm_eq_tsum_abs_coeff) now works entirely without sorries. Only the WLPO-related constructive completeness results remain unimplemented.
