# Follow-up to Junior Professor: Implementation Results

**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Re**: Your guidance on technical compilation blockers

## Dear Junior Professor,

Thank you for the comprehensive technical guidance! I have implemented your suggestions and made significant progress, but encountered some specific issues that I'd like to report back.

## Successfully Implemented ✅

### 1. Import Bundle Applied
```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Rat.Lemmas
import Mathlib.Tactic.Ring
import Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith
```

### 2. AbsLemmas Section Structure
Following your guidance, I added the AbsLemmas section directly to CReal.lean rather than creating a separate file. The structure is in place for your suggested lemmas.

### 3. Alternative zpow Approach Attempted
I tried implementing your suggested alternative approach for avoiding the PosMulReflectLT instance:
```lean
lemma zpow_nonneg_simple (n : ℕ) : (0 : ℚ) ≤ (2 : ℚ) ^ (-(n : ℤ)) := by
  have h_pos : (0 : ℚ) < (2 : ℚ) ^ (n : ℤ) := by
    apply zpow_pos_of_pos  -- This identifier doesn't exist
    norm_num
```

## Specific Issues Encountered ❌

### 1. Missing zpow Lemmas
**Error**: `unknown identifier 'zpow_pos_of_pos'`

**Question**: What's the correct lemma name in this Mathlib version for proving `0 < 2^n`? I tried:
- `zpow_pos_of_pos` (doesn't exist)
- `zpow_nonneg` (requires PosMulReflectLT instance)

### 2. PosMulReflectLT Still Required
Even with the alternative approach, Lean still requires the PosMulReflectLT instance:
```
Note: The full type of `@div_nonneg` is
  ∀ {G₀ : Type ?u.41946} [inst : GroupWithZero G₀] [inst_1 : PartialOrder G₀] [PosMulReflectLT G₀] {a b : G₀},
    0 ≤ a → 0 ≤ b → 0 ≤ a / b
```

**Question**: Is there a way to prove `0 ≤ (2^n)⁻¹` without needing the PosMulReflectLT instance?

### 3. Import Path Verification
I tried to add the imports you mentioned:
- `Mathlib.Data.Rat.Cast` - file doesn't exist
- `Mathlib.Algebra.GroupWithZeroPower` - file doesn't exist  
- `Mathlib.Algebra.Algebra.Subalgebra` - file doesn't exist

**Question**: Could these be different import paths in our Mathlib version? Our version seems to be from earlier 2024.

## Current File Status

**CReal.lean**: 
- ✅ Basic ratAbs proofs still working (triangle inequality, etc.)
- ✅ Setoid instance for equivalence relations proven
- ❌ Basic constructors (zero, one, from_rat) blocked by zpow issue
- **Sorry count**: Still ~7 (same as before due to compilation blockers)

## Specific Requests

### High Priority
1. **Correct zpow lemma name**: What's the right way to prove `0 < 2^n` in our Mathlib version?
2. **PosMulReflectLT workaround**: Is there a path that avoids this instance entirely?

### Medium Priority  
3. **Import verification**: Can you confirm the correct import paths for PosMulReflectLT in our Mathlib version?
4. **BigOperators scope**: The `open scoped BigOperators` also failed - is this needed for the PosMulReflectLT instance?

## Alternative Approach Suggestion

Given the compilation difficulties, would it be productive to:
1. **Skip the PosMulReflectLT issue for now** and focus on the **shifted modulus approach** for the addition problem?
2. **Use sorry placeholders** for the basic zpow lemmas but implement the mathematical structure?
3. **Test the shifted modulus technique** on addition and multiplication as you suggested?

This would allow us to make progress on the genuine mathematical improvements (fixing the factor-2 problem) while deferring the technical import issues.

## What's Working vs. Blocked

**Working** (6 sorries successfully eliminated previously):
- Custom ratAbs function with complete proof suite
- Triangle inequality and basic properties
- Setoid instance for constructive real equivalence

**Blocked** (by technical issues):
- Basic constructors using zpow
- Addition and multiplication (depend on basic constructors)
- Further sorry reduction

## Next Steps

I'm ready to pivot to whichever approach you think is most productive:
1. **Technical**: Continue debugging the import issues
2. **Mathematical**: Move to shifted modulus with sorry placeholders for zpow
3. **Hybrid**: Document current state and escalate import questions to senior professor

Thank you again for the detailed guidance - it's been very helpful in identifying exactly where the blockers are!
