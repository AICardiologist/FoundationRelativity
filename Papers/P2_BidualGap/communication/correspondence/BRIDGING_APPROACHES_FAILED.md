# Multiple Bridging Approaches Failed - Need Your Help

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**To**: Junior Professor  
**Subject**: Exhausted all suggested approaches - still hitting definitional equality issue

Dear Junior Professor,

I've systematically tried every suggested approach to resolve the field projection bridging issue, but they all fail at the same fundamental point. Here's what I attempted:

## **Approach 1: Your Original simpa [valid_xy, valid_x'y'] Method**

**Code:**
```lean
have valid_xy_def := valid_xy
have valid_x'y'_def := valid_x'y'
rcases valid_xy with ⟨Bx, By, hBx, hBy, hBound⟩
rcases valid_x'y' with ⟨Bx', By', hBx', hBy', hBound'⟩

have hBx_eq_final : Bx' = Bx := by
  simpa [valid_xy_def, valid_x'y'_def] using hBx_eq_raw.symm
```

**Result:** Type mismatch - field projections don't reduce to destructured variables

## **Approach 2: cases Elimination Method** 

**Code:**
```lean
have hBx_eq_final : Bx' = Bx := by
  cases hBx_eq_raw      -- substitutes, goal becomes `rfl`
  rfl
```

**Result:** `cases` works (gets to `case refl` branch) but `rfl` fails because `Bx'` and `Bx` are not definitionally equal

## **Approach 3: Explicit Unfolding**

**Code:**
```lean
unfold valid_xy_def valid_x'y'_def at hBx_eq_raw
simpa using hBx_eq_raw.symm
```

**Result:** Same type mismatch - field projections still don't connect to destructured names

## **Root Issue Confirmed**

All approaches fail at the same point: **after `rcases` destructuring, Lean 4 cannot see the definitional connection between:**

- `((uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1).Bx` (from helper lemma)
- `Bx` (from `rcases` destructuring)

Even though they represent the same mathematical object.

## **Exact Error Pattern**

Every approach produces:
```
type mismatch, term has type
  (CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.2.Bx = (CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1.Bx : Prop
but is expected to have type
  Bx' = Bx : Prop
```

## **Current Status**

- ✅ **Helper lemma works perfectly** (your design)
- ✅ **All mathematical proofs complete** (your contributions)  
- ✅ **95% sorry reduction** (123 → 6)
- ⚠️ **Only remaining issue**: These 2 definitional equality bridges

## **Code Context**

The issue is in `Papers/P2_BidualGap/Constructive/CReal/Quotient.lean` around lines 136-140:

```lean
-- This works and proves field projection equality
have hBounds_eq := CReal.uniform_shift_bounds_eq (x:=x) (x':=x') (y:=y) (y':=y') (hx:=hx) (hy:=hy)
have hBx_eq_raw := hBounds_eq.1  -- gives ((uniform_shift...).snd.1).Bx = ((uniform_shift...).snd.2).Bx

-- This destructures successfully  
rcases valid_xy with ⟨Bx, By, hBx, hBy, hBound⟩
rcases valid_x'y' with ⟨Bx', By', hBx', hBy', hBound'⟩

-- THIS is where every approach fails
have hBx_eq_final : Bx' = Bx := by
  sorry -- Cannot bridge field projections to destructured variables
```

## **Question**

Is there a different proof strategy or code structure that avoids this `rcases` definitional equality limitation entirely? 

Or perhaps a way to prove the bounds equality directly without going through the field projections?

Your mathematical insights have been brilliant throughout - hoping you can see a path through this final technical hurdle.
