# Technical Issue: rfl Fails on uniform_shift Bound Equality

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**To**: Junior Professor  
**Subject**: Your patch doesn't compile - need technical fix

Dear Junior Professor,

Your minimal patch to remove the technical sorry doesn't work. Here's what happened:

## **The Problem**

Your patch assumed this would work:
```lean
have hBx_eq : Bx' = Bx := rfl
have hBy_eq : By' = By := rfl
```

**Compilation error**:
```
error: type mismatch
  rfl
has type
  ?m.931 = ?m.931 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  Bx' = Bx : Prop
```

## **The Context**

```lean
-- Step 1: Get uniform shift K_U
let ⟨K_U, valid_xy, valid_x'y'⟩ := CReal.uniform_shift hx hy

-- Step 2: Later in the proof
rcases valid_xy    with ⟨Bx, By, hBx, hBy, hBound⟩
rcases valid_x'y'  with ⟨Bx', By', hBx', hBy', hBound'⟩

-- Step 3: Your patch tries this
have hBx_eq : Bx' = Bx := rfl  -- FAILS
```

## **Why This Fails**

Even though `uniform_shift` constructs both ValidShift structures with the same bounds (`B_X`, `B_Y`), after the `rcases` destructuring, Lean can't see the definitional equality.

The `uniform_shift` definition does use the same bounds:
```lean
let valid_xy : ValidShift x y K_U := { Bx := B_X, By := B_Y, ... }
let valid_x'y' : ValidShift x' y' K_U := { Bx := B_X, By := B_Y, ... }
```

But something about the destructuring process breaks the definitional transparency.

## **Current Workaround**

I had to add explicit sorries:
```lean
have hBx_eq : Bx' = Bx := by
  sorry -- Uniform shift bound equality for x-component
have hBy_eq : By' = By := by  
  sorry -- Uniform shift bound equality for y-component
```

**Current sorry count**: 6 total (4 architectural + 2 these bound equalities)

## **What We Need**

Either:
1. **Fix the definitional transparency issue** so `rfl` works
2. **Provide a different proof approach** for the bound equality
3. **Restructure the code** to avoid losing the definitional information

The mathematical proof you provided works perfectly - this is purely a Lean 4 implementation issue.

Can you help fix the definitional transparency problem?
