# Debugging Report: simpa Bridging Issue

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**To**: Junior Professor  
**Subject**: Your precise bridging solution encounters type mismatch

Dear Junior Professor,

I've implemented your precise bridging solution exactly as specified, but encountering a persistent type mismatch with the `simpa` step.

## **What I Implemented (Following Your Instructions Exactly)**

```lean
-- Step 1: obtain equalities before destructuring
have hBounds_eq :=
  CReal.uniform_shift_bounds_eq (x:=x) (x':=x') (y:=y) (y':=y')
                                (hx:=hx) (hy:=hy)
have hBx_eq_raw := hBounds_eq.1
have hBy_eq_raw := hBounds_eq.2

-- Step 2: destructure the ValidShifts
rcases valid_xy   with ⟨Bx,  By,  hBx,  hBy,  hBound⟩
rcases valid_x'y' with ⟨Bx', By', hBx', hBy', hBound'⟩

-- Step 3: use simpa (YOUR SUGGESTED APPROACH)
have hBx_eq_final : Bx' = Bx := by
  simpa using hBx_eq_raw.symm
```

## **The Error**

```
error: type mismatch, term
  Eq.symm hBx_eq_raw
after simplification has type
  (CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.2.Bx = (CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1.Bx : Prop
but is expected to have type
  Bx' = Bx : Prop
```

## **Analysis**

The `simpa` is **not** reducing the field projections to the destructured names as expected. After `rcases`:

- `hBx_eq_raw` still contains: `((uniform_shift ...).snd.1).Bx = ((uniform_shift ...).snd.2).Bx`
- But we need: `Bx' = Bx`
- `simpa` isn't making the connection between field projections and destructured variables

## **Possible Issues**

1. **Definitional reduction not happening**: The field projections aren't being reduced to the `rcases` names
2. **Scope issue**: The `uniform_shift` calls might not be recognized as identical
3. **Missing simp lemma**: Maybe there's a specific lemma needed for `rcases` field projection reduction

## **Questions**

1. Should the `simpa` automatically know that `Bx` (from `rcases`) is definitionally equal to `((uniform_shift ...).snd.1).Bx`?
2. Is there a specific simp configuration or lemma needed?
3. Could there be an issue with how the `uniform_shift` call is being elaborated?

## **Current Status**

- ✅ **Helper lemma works perfectly**: `uniform_shift_bounds_eq` compiles and proves the field equalities
- ✅ **All mathematical content intact**: Your sophisticated proof continues to work
- ⚠️ **Only the final bridging step fails**: `simpa` doesn't connect field projections to destructured names

**Sorry count**: Still 6 (4 architectural + 2 these bridging steps)

The issue seems to be a Lean 4 mechanics problem with definitional reduction after `rcases`, not with your mathematical approach.

Could you help debug why the `simpa` isn't working as expected?
