# Implementation Status: Junior Professor's Definitional Equality Approach

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Subject**: Current status after attempting your definitional equality fix

Dear Junior Professor,

I've implemented your approach but am having technical difficulties with the final bridging step. Here's the current situation:

## ‚úÖ **What Works**

1. **Helper lemma added successfully**:
```lean
lemma uniform_shift_bounds_eq {x x' y y' : CReal} {hx : x ‚âà x'} {hy : y ‚âà y'} :
  let data := CReal.uniform_shift hx hy
  (((data.2).1).Bx = ((data.2).2).Bx) ‚àß
  (((data.2).1).By = ((data.2).2).By) := by
  dsimp [CReal.uniform_shift]
  simp
```
This compiles and works correctly.

2. **Mathematical proof structure intact**: Your complete 140+ line mathematical proof continues to work perfectly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Technical Issue: Bridging Step**

The problem is in connecting the field projection equalities to the destructured variables:

```lean
-- This works and gives us field projection equality:
have h := CReal.uniform_shift_bounds_eq (x:=x) (x':=x') (y:=y) (y':=y') (hx:=hx) (hy:=hy)
-- h.1 : ((uniform_shift ...).2).1.Bx = ((uniform_shift ...).2).2.Bx

-- After rcases:
rcases valid_xy with ‚ü®Bx, By, hBx, hBy, hBound‚ü©
rcases valid_x'y' with ‚ü®Bx', By', hBx', hBy', hBound'‚ü©

-- Need to prove: Bx' = Bx
-- But can't bridge from field projections to destructured variables
```

## üîß **What I've Tried**

1. **Direct simpa**: `simpa using hBx_eq` - type mismatch
2. **Manual bridging with rfl**: `rfl` fails after destructuring  
3. **Simp-based approaches**: Can't rewrite field projections to destructured names

The issue seems to be that once `rcases` creates fresh local constants `Bx, Bx'`, Lean loses the connection to the original field projections.

## üìä **Current Status**

**Sorry count**: 6 total
- **4 in Completeness.lean** (architectural)
- **2 in Quotient.lean** (bridging from field equality to destructured variables)

**The core mathematics works perfectly** - this is purely a Lean 4 implementation mechanics issue.

## ü§î **Question**

Could you clarify the exact mechanics of how `simpa` should rewrite the field projections to the destructured names? 

The pattern you suggested:
```lean
have hBx_eq : Bx' = Bx := by
  simpa using hBx_eq
```

Results in:
```
type mismatch: 
  after simplification has type: (uniform_shift ...).snd.1.Bx = (uniform_shift ...).snd.2.Bx
  but is expected to have type: Bx' = Bx
```

Is there a specific simp lemma or approach needed to make this connection?

## ‚úÖ **Bottom Line**

Your mathematical approach is completely correct and the helper lemma works. We just need the final technical step to bridge from field projections to destructured variables.

All the sophisticated mathematical content you provided compiles and works correctly. This is a minor implementation detail, not a mathematical issue.
