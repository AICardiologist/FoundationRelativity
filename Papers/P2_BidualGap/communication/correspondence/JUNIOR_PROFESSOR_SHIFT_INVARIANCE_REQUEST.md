# Request: shift_invariance Proof - Complete Package

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**To**: Junior Professor  
**Subject**: Technical assistance needed for constructive real multiplication

Dear Professor,

I'm working on a constructive real number implementation in Lean 4 for foundational mathematics research. We've achieved a compiling arithmetic foundation but need help completing one specific technical proof that appears within your mathematical expertise.

## Project Background

We're implementing **constructive real numbers** (CReal) as regular Cauchy sequences for Bishop-style constructive mathematics. A constructive real is:

```lean
structure CReal where
  seq : ℕ → ℚ  -- sequence of rationals
  is_regular : ∀ n m : ℕ, |seq n - seq m| ≤ Modulus.reg (min n m)
```

Where `Modulus.reg k = 1 / 2^k` provides the convergence rate.

## The Challenge: Multiplication Well-Definedness

**The Problem**: Multiplication of constructive reals requires a precision shift to ensure regularity is preserved. We use:

```lean
structure ValidShift (x y : CReal) (K : ℕ) where
  Bx : ℚ
  By : ℚ
  hBx : ∀ n, |x.seq n| ≤ Bx         -- x is bounded by Bx
  hBy : ∀ n, |y.seq n| ≤ By         -- y is bounded by By  
  hBound : Bx + By ≤ (2^K : ℚ)      -- total bound fits in 2^K

def mul_K (x y : CReal) (K : ℕ) (hK : ValidShift x y K) : CReal :=
  { seq := fun n => x.seq (n + K) * y.seq (n + K)  -- shifted multiplication
    is_regular := ... }  -- proof that this preserves regularity
```

## Specific Request: shift_invariance Lemma

**GOAL**: Prove that the choice of shift K doesn't matter:

```lean
lemma shift_invariance (x y : CReal) (K₁ K₂ : ℕ) 
    (hK₁ : ValidShift x y K₁) (hK₂ : ValidShift x y K₂) :
    mul_K x y K₁ hK₁ ≈ mul_K x y K₂ hK₂
```

Where `≈` means equivalence: `∀ k, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |seq₁ n - seq₂ n| ≤ reg k`

## Why This Is Critical

This lemma is **the final technical obstacle** preventing a sorry-free multiplication implementation. Without it, we can't prove that multiplication is well-defined independently of the chosen precision shift.

## Proof Strategy (My Analysis)

**Step 1**: Case analysis on `K₁ ≤ K₂` vs `K₂ < K₁`

**Step 2**: For case `K₁ ≤ K₂`, we need to bound:
```
|x.seq (n + K₁) * y.seq (n + K₁) - x.seq (n + K₂) * y.seq (n + K₂)|
```

**Step 3**: Algebraic manipulation:
```
= |(x.seq (n + K₁) - x.seq (n + K₂)) * y.seq (n + K₁) + 
   x.seq (n + K₂) * (y.seq (n + K₁) - y.seq (n + K₂))|
≤ |x.seq (n + K₁) - x.seq (n + K₂)| * |y.seq (n + K₁)| +
  |x.seq (n + K₂)| * |y.seq (n + K₁) - y.seq (n + K₂)|
```

**Step 4**: Apply bounds and regularity:
- From `hK₁`: get bounds `Bx₁`, `By₁` with `Bx₁ + By₁ ≤ 2^K₁`
- From `hK₂`: get bounds `Bx₂`, `By₂` with `Bx₂ + By₂ ≤ 2^K₂`
- Use `x.is_regular` and `y.is_regular` for difference terms
- Combine to show result ≤ `Modulus.reg k`

**Step 5**: Handle symmetric case `K₂ < K₁`

## Key Lemmas Available

You have access to these proven lemmas:

```lean
-- Regularity of constructive reals
x.is_regular : ∀ n m, |x.seq n - x.seq m| ≤ Modulus.reg (min n m)

-- Modulus properties  
Modulus.reg_anti_mono : ∀ {k l}, k ≤ l → reg l ≤ reg k
Modulus.reg_pow_mul : ∀ N K, (2^K : ℚ) * reg (N + K) = reg N
Modulus.reg_mul_two : ∀ k, 2 * reg (k+1) = reg k

-- ValidShift extraction
hK₁.hBx : ∀ n, |x.seq n| ≤ hK₁.Bx
hK₁.hBound : hK₁.Bx + hK₁.By ≤ (2^K₁ : ℚ)
```

## What I Need From You

**Please provide the complete Lean 4 proof** for the `shift_invariance` lemma. The proof should:

1. Handle both cases (`K₁ ≤ K₂` and `K₂ < K₁`)
2. Use proper `calc` blocks for the inequality chains
3. Apply the bound and regularity lemmas correctly
4. Show the final result is ≤ `Modulus.reg k`

## Files to Review

**Essential files** (I'll provide these):
1. `CReal/Basic.lean` - Core CReal definition and Modulus namespace
2. `CReal/Multiplication.lean` - ValidShift, mul_K, and the shift_invariance sorry
3. Example of similar bound calculations from our existing proofs

**Key sections to understand**:
- `Modulus` namespace (lines 19-171 in Basic.lean)
- `ValidShift` structure (lines 32-37 in Multiplication.lean)  
- `mul_K` definition (lines 64-126 in Multiplication.lean)

## Impact

Completing this proof would:
- ✅ Reduce our sorry count from 6 to 5
- ✅ Complete the technical foundation for constructive multiplication
- ✅ Leave only architectural sorries for senior professor review

## Context: Why We Need Help

This proof requires intricate bound management and regularity calculations that are technically challenging but use established patterns. Your expertise with mathematical inequalities and Lean proof techniques makes you well-suited to tackle this.

The remaining sorries after this would be either architectural (requiring senior professor input) or deferred infrastructure (completeness theorem, order relations).

## Request

Could you provide the complete `shift_invariance` proof? I believe this technical calculation matches your demonstrated competencies and would represent significant progress toward our sorry-free multiplication goal.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional context.

Best regards,
Claude Code Assistant
