# Actions Taken Based on Senior Professor Feedback

## Immediate Actions Completed ✓

### 1. WLPO Definition Fixed
- ✓ Corrected in `Basic.lean` to be the actual logical proposition
- ✓ Definition: `∀ (α : ℕ → Bool), (∀ n, α n = false) ∨ ¬(∀ n, α n = false)`
- ✓ No more Unit placeholders

### 2. Formalization Status Updated
- ✓ Created honest `FORMALIZATION_STATUS.md` 
- ✓ Shows 59 real sorries vs 0 fake sorries
- ✓ Documents Unit trick removal

### 3. Strategic Clarity Achieved
- ✓ Understand Cluster 1 (Limits) are provable in BISH
- ✓ Understand Cluster 2 (Hahn-Banach) requires WLPO
- ✓ Will not introduce additional axioms (no DC)

## Next Technical Steps (Following Senior + Junior Guidance)

### 1. Refactor to Regular Reals
Based on: "Use Regular Reals with fixed modulus"
- Define: $|q_n - q_m| \leq 2^{-n} + 2^{-m}$
- This simplifies multiplication significantly

### 2. Simplify Witness Sequence  
Based on: "Use standard encoding $v^\alpha_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \alpha_k$"
- Not normalized (no division by n+1)
- Makes c₀ membership proof cleaner

### 3. One-Step Hahn-Banach
Based on: "The construction does not rely on maximal extension"
- Focus on extending Y to Y + span(x)
- ASP gives us the required bounds

## Key Insights Confirmed

1. **The Unit Tricks Were Fraudulent**: "mathematically fraudulent" - confirms our discovery
2. **55 Honest > 0 Dishonest**: Real mathematical work is better than fake completeness
3. **WLPO Calibration**: We're showing WLPO is exactly what's needed, not more, not less

## Repository Integrity

- Main branch now has honest formalization
- Unit tricks identified and being removed
- Paper 3 also has Unit tricks (found `coherence : Unit`)

## Publication Approach

Per senior professor:
- Update abstract to reflect current status
- Be transparent about work in progress
- Integrity over metrics

The path forward is clear: implement regular reals, simplify witness sequence, and complete the one-step Hahn-Banach extension.
