- **Multiplication.lean**: Complete junior professor multiplication with uniform shift technique

### Ready for Implementation (6 technical sorries)
- **Quotient.lean**: 3 sorries - RC-level properties (triangle inequality, additivity, extraction bounds)
- **Completeness.lean**: 3 sorries - Regularization witness constructions, diagonal proof, convergence composition

## Key Question for Junior Professor

Based on your expertise with elementary tactics, **which sorries would you like to tackle first**?

### Option A: Core Regularization (Mathematical Priority)
Focus on `Completeness.lean` sorries #1-2:
- `phi_increasing` monotonicity  
- `diag.is_regular` proof using speed-up bound

These are the **mathematical heart** of the regularization technique.

### Option B: RC Properties (Foundation Building)  
Focus on `Quotient.lean` sorries #7-8:
- `dist_triangle` at quotient level
- `leR_add` additivity property

These establish **clean RC-level reasoning** for future work.

### Option C: Extraction Investigation (Technical Debugging)
Investigate the arithmetic issue in extraction lemma sorry #10:
```lean
have h_bound : (2 : ℚ) ≤ 2 * Modulus.reg k := by
  cases k with
  | zero => rw [h_reg0]; norm_num  -- ✅ Works: 2 ≤ 2*1 = 2
  | succ k' => sorry -- ❌ Problem: 2 ≤ 2*(1/2^k) fails for k > 0
```

This appears to be a **genuine mathematical constraint** that needs resolution.

## Technical Resources Available

### Established Lemmas You Can Use
```lean
-- From Senior Professor's breakthrough:
lemma speed_up_bound (k : ℕ) : 6 * Modulus.reg (k + 3) ≤ Modulus.reg k
lemma leR_witness (x y : RC) (k : ℕ) (h : RC.leR x y) :
    ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, (repr x).seq n ≤ (repr y).seq n + 2 * Modulus.reg k

-- Core infrastructure:
lemma reg_mul_two (k : ℕ) : 2 * Modulus.reg (k+1) = Modulus.reg k
lemma reg_anti_mono {k l : ℕ} (h : k ≤ l) : Modulus.reg l ≤ Modulus.reg k
```

### Tactical Approach Confirmed
All sorries appear to need only:
- Basic inequality chains (`calc`, `linarith`)
- Existential constructions (`use`, `obtain`)  
- Function applications (`apply`, `exact`)
- Case analysis (`cases`)

**No complex tactics required** - this is within your wheelhouse!

## My Recommendation

**Start with Option B** (RC Properties) first:
1. Implement `dist_triangle` and `leR_add` - these are **self-contained** 
2. Move to Option A (Core Regularization) - these are **mathematically important**
3. Address Option C (Extraction Investigation) last - this may need **arithmetic redesign**

The extraction lemma arithmetic issue (#10) suggests we might need to:
- Accept a looser bound than `r + 4*reg(k)`
- Use different intermediate points in the triangle inequality
- Rethink the coefficient management

But the other 5 sorries should be **straightforward elementary implementations**.
