# Consultant 2 Approach Implementation Results

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**To**: Consultant 2  
**Subject**: Your let projection approach still encounters the fundamental definitional equality issue

Dear Consultant,

Thank you for your detailed analysis and the `let` projection solution. Your insight about `rcases` breaking definitional equality chains is excellent and the approach should theoretically work.

## **Implementation Results**

I implemented your approach exactly as specified:

```lean
-- Helper lemma proves field projection equality
have hBounds_eq := CReal.uniform_shift_bounds_eq (x:=x) (x':=x') (y:=y) (y':=y') (hx:=hx) (hy:=hy)
have hBx_eq_raw := hBounds_eq.1
have hBy_eq_raw := hBounds_eq.2

-- SOLUTION from Consultant 2: Use let projections instead of rcases destructuring
-- This preserves definitional equality chains that rcases breaks
let Bx := valid_xy.Bx
let By := valid_xy.By
let hBx := valid_xy.hBx
let hBy := valid_xy.hBy
let hBound := valid_xy.hBound
let Bx' := valid_x'y'.Bx
let By' := valid_x'y'.By
let hBx' := valid_x'y'.hBx
let hBy' := valid_x'y'.hBy
let hBound' := valid_x'y'.hBound

-- Connect the equalities directly - projections preserve definitional equality
have hBx_eq_final : Bx' = Bx := hBx_eq_raw.symm  -- FAILS HERE
have hBy_eq_final : By' = By := hBy_eq_raw.symm
```

## **Error Encountered**

**Same fundamental type mismatch**:
```
type mismatch
  Eq.symm hBx_eq_raw
has type
  (CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.2.Bx = (CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1.Bx : Prop
but is expected to have type
  Bx' = Bx : Prop
```

## **Deeper Issue Revealed**

Your analysis correctly identified that `rcases` breaks definitional equality, but the issue goes one level deeper:

**The root problem is in the original `let` destructuring itself**:
```lean
let ⟨K_U, valid_xy, valid_x'y'⟩ := CReal.uniform_shift hx hy
```

Even here, `valid_xy` is not definitionally equal to `(CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1`, so:
- `valid_xy.Bx` ≠ `((CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1).Bx` definitionally
- `valid_x'y'.Bx` ≠ `((CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.2).Bx` definitionally

This means that even with your `let` projections:
- `Bx` (which is `valid_xy.Bx`) ≠ `((uniform_shift ...).snd.1).Bx` definitionally
- `Bx'` (which is `valid_x'y'.Bx`) ≠ `((uniform_shift ...).snd.2).Bx` definitionally

## **The Classical.choose Factor**

The fundamental issue appears to be that `uniform_shift` uses `Classical.choose` constructions:

```lean
noncomputable def uniform_shift {x x' y y' : CReal} (hx : x ≈ x') (hy : y ≈ y') :
    Σ K_U : ℕ, (ValidShift x y K_U) × (ValidShift x' y' K_U) :=
  let B_X := Classical.choose (common_bound hx)
  let B_Y := Classical.choose (common_bound hy)  
  let K_U := Classical.choose (Modulus.exists_pow_le (B_X + B_Y))
  -- Both ValidShifts constructed with identical bounds B_X, B_Y
  ⟨K_U, ⟨{Bx := B_X, By := B_Y, ...}, {Bx := B_X, By := B_Y, ...}⟩⟩
```

The `Classical.choose` makes the entire construction opaque, so even the initial `let` destructuring loses definitional connection to the field projections.

## **Potential Solutions?**

Based on your analysis, would any of these work:

1. **Avoid the initial `let` destructuring entirely**:
   ```lean
   -- Work directly with (uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1 and (uniform_shift hx hy).snd.2
   -- But this makes the code much more verbose and hard to read
   ```

2. **Restructure `uniform_shift`** to return a more transparent structure that doesn't break definitional equality?

3. **Use a computational (non-Classical.choose) version** of `uniform_shift` if possible?

## **Question**

Your theoretical analysis is spot-on about `rcases` vs projections. The issue seems to be that we hit this definitional equality problem even before we get to destructuring - it's in the `Classical.choose` opacity of `uniform_shift` itself.

Do you have suggestions for working around the `Classical.choose` opacity issue, or alternative ways to structure the `uniform_shift` construction that would preserve definitional equality?

## **Appreciation**

Your explanation of the `rcases` vs projection difference is extremely valuable and will be useful for future Lean 4 work. The approach is theoretically correct - we're just hitting a deeper layer of the opacity issue than initially apparent.
