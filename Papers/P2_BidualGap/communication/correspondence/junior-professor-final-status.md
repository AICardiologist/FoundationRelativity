## **Key Discovery**: Quotient Induction Functions

### **Issue Identified**:
Your `Quotient.induction_on₃` and `Quotient.induction_on₄` functions are **not available** in this Lean 4.22.0 environment. Only basic `Quotient.induction_on` (single) exists.

### **Your Advanced Quotient Techniques Needed**:
1. **Multi-quotient induction patterns**
2. **Sequence-level quotient unfolding** 
3. **Complex `dsimp` applications for nested quotient structures**
4. **Quotient lift mechanics for representative access**

---

## **Precise Implementation Requirements**

### **Quotient.lean (3 sorries)**:

#### **1. `dist_triangle` (Line 308)**
```lean
-- Your approach: Quotient.induction_on₃ x y z + CReal triangle inequality
-- Current issue: Need multi-quotient induction technique
-- Mathematics: |x-z| ≤ |x-y| + |y-z| at representative level
```

#### **2. `add_leR` (Line 317)**  
```lean  
-- Your approach: Quotient.induction_on₄ a b c d + witness combination
-- Current issue: Need 4-way quotient opening
-- Mathematics: Monotonicity a≤c, b≤d → a+b≤c+d
```

#### **3. `dist_pointwise` (Line 324)**
```lean
-- Your approach: leR_witness + quotient unfolding to sequence level
-- Current issue: Complex quotient-to-sequence bound extraction  
-- Mathematics: RC.dist bound → sequence difference bound with 4*reg n slack
```

### **Completeness.lean (3 sorries)**:

#### **4. `witness_mono` (Line 67)**
```lean
-- Pure Nat arithmetic - no quotients involved
-- Mathematics: Show max(N₁, old_witness)+1 preserves monotonicity
-- Approach: Induction on Nat with careful case analysis
```

#### **5. `diag.is_regular` (Line 79)**
```lean  
-- Your approach: combine dist_pointwise + witness_property + speed_up_bound
-- Dependencies: Requires dist_pointwise from Quotient.lean
-- Mathematics: 6*reg(i+3) ≤ reg(i) absorbs regularization error
```

#### **6. Convergence witnesses (Lines 89+)**
```lean
-- Various witness constructions for completeness proof
-- Dependencies: Requires dist_triangle, add_leR from Quotient.lean  
-- Mathematics: Triangle inequality composition with precision shifting
```

## **Recommended Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1**: Quotient Fundamentals
**Focus**: Complete `dist_triangle` first as the foundational example
- **Challenge**: Multi-quotient induction technique
- **Payoff**: Establishes the quotient manipulation pattern for others

### **Phase 2**: Copy-and-Adapt 
**Focus**: Use `dist_triangle` pattern for `add_leR` and `dist_pointwise`
- **Benefit**: Systematic replication of quotient techniques
- **Timeline**: Should be straightforward once pattern is established

### **Phase 3**: Regularization Assembly
**Focus**: Complete Completeness.lean using established Quotient.lean lemmas
- **Mathematics**: Straight `linarith` calculations as you predicted
- **Dependencies**: Requires Phase 1 & 2 completion

## **Your Quotient Expertise Required**

### **Core Question**: 
**How do you implement multi-quotient induction in Lean 4.22.0?**

**Options**:
1. **Nested `Quotient.induction_on`** - as I attempted (didn't work cleanly)
2. **Alternative quotient manipulation technique** - your expertise needed
3. **Direct representative access** - using `RC.repr` more systematically
4. **Custom quotient lemmas** - if standard functions are insufficient

### **Specific Help Needed**:
- **Working `dist_triangle` implementation** showing the exact quotient technique
- **Guidance on sequence-level bound extraction** for `dist_pointwise`
- **Verification of Lean 4.22.0 quotient function availability**
