# Senior Professor Directive: Resolving Compilation Issues

**Subject**: Directive: Resolving Compilation Issues via Definitional Transparency and Modularization

Dear Assistant,

The timeouts and the difficulties extracting equalities from `uniform_shift` point to architectural issues in the Lean implementation regarding definitional opacity and monolithic proof structures. The mathematical strategy is sound; we must now correct the engineering.

## 1. The `uniform_shift` Architecture (Resolving the 2 Technical Sorries)

The sorries for $B_X' = B_X$ and $B_Y' = B_Y$ exist because the current `uniform_shift` implementation does not guarantee that the bounds used for the two pairs are definitionally the same object in Lean. These equalities should be provable by `rfl` (by definition), not require a proof or `sorry`.

**The Fix: Implement `uniform_shift` using Canonical Common Bounds.**

You must ensure that `uniform_shift` explicitly utilizes the `Common Bound Lemma` to extract the bounds *once* and then uses those specific bounds to construct both `ValidShift` structures.

**Action: Refactor `uniform_shift`.**

```lean
def CReal.uniform_shift {x x' y y' : CReal} (hx : x ≈ x') (hy : y ≈ y') :
  ∃ K_U : ℕ, (ValidShift x y K_U) ∧ (ValidShift x' y' K_U) := by
  -- Extract the COMMON bounds using Classical.choose on the lemma.
  let B_X := Classical.choose (common_bound hx)
  let hB_X := Classical.choose_spec (common_bound hx)
  -- Construct the ValidShift records using THE SAME bounds.
  -- This ensures definitional equality.
```

## 2. Proof Complexity and Timeouts (`mul_respects_equiv`)

**Action 1: Ensure Definitional Transparency of `CReal.mul`.**

```lean
def get_shift (x y : CReal) : Σ K : ℕ, ValidShift x y K := ...

def CReal.mul (x y : CReal) : CReal :=
  let data := get_shift x y
  mul_K x y data.1 data.2
```

**Action 2: Restructure `mul_respects_equiv` using Transitivity.**

Break the proof down using the structure: `CReal.mul x y ≈ Z_xy ≈ Z_x'y' ≈ CReal.mul x' y'`.

## 3. Performance Management and File Structure

**Yes, immediately.** `CReal.lean` is too large. Managing complexity requires modular files.

1. `Constructive/CReal/Basic.lean`: CReal definition, Modulus, Boundedness, Archimedean, Add, Neg, Setoid.
2. `Constructive/CReal/Multiplication.lean`: ValidShift, get_shift, mul_K, shift_invariance, CReal.mul, common_bound.
3. `Constructive/CReal/Quotient.lean`: RC definition, uniform_shift, well-definedness proofs, lifted operations.
4. `Constructive/CReal/Completeness.lean`: Metric structure, order relations, Completeness theorem.

## Summary Directive

1. **Split the files** immediately.
2. **Refactor `CReal.mul`** for definitional transparency.
3. **Refactor `uniform_shift`** to use `common_bound` explicitly, resolving the 2 technical sorries by `rfl`.
4. **Restructure `mul_respects_equiv`** using transitivity and modularization to resolve timeouts.

Execute these engineering corrections. This will result in a compiling, sorry-free arithmetic foundation.

Sincerely,
Senior Professor
