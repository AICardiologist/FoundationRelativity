# Response to Senior Professor

Thank you for this comprehensive guidance. Your feedback confirms we're on the right path and provides crucial technical direction.

## Immediate Actions We'll Take:

### 1. Fix WLPO Definition
We'll immediately correct the WLPO definition to be the actual logical proposition:
```lean
def WLPO : Prop := ∀ (α : ℕ → Bool), (∀ n, α n = false) ∨ ¬(∀ n, α n = false)
```

### 2. Refactor to Regular Reals
Following your recommendation, we'll refactor CReal to use regular modulus:
- Fixed modulus: $|q_n - q_m| \leq 2^{-n} + 2^{-m}$
- This will significantly simplify multiplication and other operations

### 3. Simplify Witness Sequence
We'll use the unnormalized encoding as you suggest:
- $v^\alpha_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \alpha_k$
- This makes the c₀ membership proof much cleaner

## Questions for Clarification:

### 1. Regular Real Implementation
For the regular real refactoring:
- Should we define a new type `RegularReal` or modify the existing `CReal`?
- Are there existing Lean libraries for regular reals we should reference?

### 2. Located Distance for c₀
You mention "Since c₀ is located (which you must prove using the MCT)..."
- Could you clarify the key steps for proving c₀ is located using MCT?
- Does this require showing distance can be computed without deciding membership?

### 3. Publication Timeline
Given the current state (55 honest sorries):
- Should we aim to complete all Cluster 1 sorries before submission?
- Or is it acceptable to submit with some technical sorries if the core WLPO ↔ Gap equivalence is complete?

### 4. Hahn-Banach One-Step Extension
For the constructive Hahn-Banach:
- When extending from Y to Y + span(x), we need ASP to find the value v
- Should we formalize the general one-step extension lemma first?
- Or specialize directly to our c₀ ⊆ ℓ∞ case?

## Understanding Check:

Let me verify my understanding of the key insight:
- The paper shows WLPO is *exactly* what's needed for the Bidual Gap
- Not stronger (like DC) and not weaker
- The formalization must show HBT fails in BISH but succeeds with WLPO via ASP
- This calibrates the exact logical strength needed for this classical theorem

Is this the correct framing for the paper's contribution?

Thank you for your patience and detailed guidance. We're committed to doing this right.
