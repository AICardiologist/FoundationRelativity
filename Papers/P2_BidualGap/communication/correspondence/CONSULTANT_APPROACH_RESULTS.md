# Consultant Approach Implementation Results

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**To**: Consultant 1  
**Subject**: Your rcases h: pattern approach still encounters the same definitional equality issue

Dear Consultant,

Thank you for your excellent analysis and proposed solution using the `rcases h : ...` pattern. Your explanation of the definitional vs propositional equality distinction is spot-on and very helpful.

## **Implementation Results**

I implemented your approach exactly as specified:

```lean
-- Get helper lemma equalities 
have hBounds_eq := CReal.uniform_shift_bounds_eq (x:=x) (x':=x') (y:=y) (y':=y') (hx:=hx) (hy:=hy)
have hBx_eq_raw := hBounds_eq.1
have hBy_eq_raw := hBounds_eq.2

-- Key insight: Use rcases h : ... pattern to save equality hypotheses
rcases h_xy : valid_xy with ⟨Bx, By, hBx, hBy, hBound⟩
rcases h_x'y' : valid_x'y' with ⟨Bx', By', hBx', hBy', hBound'⟩
-- Now we have bridge equations:
-- h_xy   : valid_xy = ⟨Bx, By, hBx, hBy, hBound⟩
-- h_x'y' : valid_x'y' = ⟨Bx', By', hBx', hBy', hBound'⟩

-- Attempt to bridge using your approach
have hBx_eq_final : Bx' = Bx := by
  have : valid_xy.Bx = valid_x'y'.Bx := by
    rw [show valid_xy.Bx = ((CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1).Bx from rfl]  -- FAILS HERE
    rw [show valid_x'y'.Bx = ((CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.2).Bx from rfl]
    exact hBx_eq_raw
  rw [h_xy, h_x'y'] at this
  simp at this
  exact this.symm
```

## **Error Encountered**

**Same fundamental issue**:
```
type mismatch
  rfl
has type
  ?m.873 = ?m.873 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  valid_xy.Bx = (CReal.uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1.Bx : Prop
```

## **Root Issue Confirmed**

Your analysis correctly identified that the problem is definitional vs propositional equality. However, the issue goes even deeper than `rcases` destructuring:

**The fundamental blocker is that `valid_xy.Bx` is not definitionally equal to `((uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1).Bx`**, even though they refer to the same mathematical object.

This happens because:
1. `valid_xy` comes from the `let` destructuring: `let ⟨K_U, valid_xy, valid_x'y'⟩ := CReal.uniform_shift hx hy`
2. But `valid_xy` as a local variable is not definitionally equal to `(uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1`
3. The `Classical.choose` constructions in `uniform_shift` make the terms opaque

## **Deeper Analysis**

The issue isn't just with `rcases` - it's with the entire `let` binding pattern:

```lean
let ⟨K_U, valid_xy, valid_x'y'⟩ := CReal.uniform_shift hx hy
-- Even here: valid_xy ≠ (uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1 definitionally
```

So the `rcases h : ...` pattern, while excellent in general, can't resolve this because the bridge equation `h_xy : valid_xy = ⟨Bx, By, ...⟩` still doesn't connect `valid_xy` to the field projection `((uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1)` definitionally.

## **Questions**

1. **Is there a way to make the `let` destructuring preserve definitional equality** with the original field projections?

2. **Could we restructure to avoid the `let` destructuring entirely** and work directly with `(uniform_shift hx hy).snd.1` and `(uniform_shift hx hy).snd.2`?

3. **Are there tactics specifically designed** for bridging across `Classical.choose` constructions?

## **Appreciation**

Your explanation of the definitional/propositional distinction and the `rcases h : ...` pattern is extremely valuable and will be useful for future Lean 4 work. The approach is mathematically sound - we're just hitting a deeper layer of the definitional equality limitation.

The issue appears to be not just `rcases`, but the entire pattern of `let` destructuring combined with `Classical.choose` opacity in `uniform_shift`.

Would you have any additional insights on handling this deeper definitional equality issue?
