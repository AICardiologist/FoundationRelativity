# Request: shift_invariance Proof Assistance

**Date**: 2025-08-05
**To**: Junior Professor
**Subject**: Technical assistance for shift_invariance lemma completion

Dear Junior Professor,

Following the successful implementation of your corrected patches, we have achieved full compilation with only 6 sorries remaining. I'm writing to request assistance with one specific technical proof that appears within your expertise.

## The Issue: shift_invariance Lemma

**Location**: `CReal/Multiplication.lean:131`

```lean
lemma shift_invariance (x y : CReal) (K₁ K₂ : ℕ) 
    (hK₁ : ValidShift x y K₁) (hK₂ : ValidShift x y K₂) :
    mul_K x y K₁ hK₁ ≈ mul_K x y K₂ hK₂ := by sorry
```

## What This Proves

This lemma shows that multiplication is independent of the chosen precision shift. Regardless of whether we use shift `K₁` or `K₂`, the result `mul_K` should be equivalent in the setoid sense.

## My Partial Progress

I started the proof using the standard approach:

```lean
-- Case analysis: WLOG assume K₁ ≤ K₂
by_cases h : K₁ ≤ K₂

-- Algebraic manipulation to split the difference:
calc |x.seq (n + K₁) * y.seq (n + K₁) - x.seq (n + K₂) * y.seq (n + K₂)|
    = |(x.seq (n + K₁) - x.seq (n + K₂)) * y.seq (n + K₁) +
       x.seq (n + K₂) * (y.seq (n + K₁) - y.seq (n + K₂))| := by ring

-- Apply bounds from ValidShift structures:
-- hK₁ gives us bounds Bx₁, By₁ with Bx₁ + By₁ ≤ 2^K₁  
-- hK₂ gives us bounds Bx₂, By₂ with Bx₂ + By₂ ≤ 2^K₂
```

## The Technical Challenge

The proof requires:
1. **Bound management**: Using the ValidShift bounds effectively
2. **Regularity application**: Applying `x.is_regular` and `y.is_regular` 
3. **Precision control**: Showing the final result ≤ `Modulus.reg k`
4. **Symmetric case**: Handling `K₂ < K₁` similarly

## Why I Think This Is Within Your Scope

Your corrected patches demonstrated strong competence with:
- Bound calculations and inequalities
- Regularity lemma applications  
- The `reg_mul_two` relationship: `2 * reg(k+1) = reg(k)`
- Modulus arithmetic and `reg_pow_mul`

This proof uses the same techniques at a slightly higher complexity level.

## Request

Could you provide the complete proof for the `shift_invariance` lemma? I believe this is the type of technical calculation you've shown proficiency with, and it would reduce our sorry count significantly.

## Context

This would leave us with:
- 1 architectural sorry (needs senior professor)
- 4 completeness sorries (deferred infrastructure)

Getting this technical proof completed would represent major progress toward a sorry-free arithmetic foundation.

Thank you for your continued assistance with this implementation.

Best regards,
