# Paper 2 Professor Correspondence

This directory contains all communication with the senior professor regarding the WLPO ↔ BidualGap equivalence implementation.

## Files

- `PROFESSOR_NOTE_P2.md` - Initial implementation guidance request
  - **Status**: Ready to send
  - **Purpose**: Request specific references for Ishihara argument and c₀/ℓ∞ construction
  - **Context**: Honest stubs are in place, need mathematical guidance to fill them

## Future Files

- `professor_reply_1.md` - Professors response with references/guidance
- `implementation_questions.md` - Follow-up technical questions during implementation  
- `review_request.md` - Request for proof verification once complete

## Communication Protocol

1. **Initial request** - Mathematical guidance and references
2. **Implementation phase** - Technical clarifications as needed
3. **Review phase** - Final proof verification and validation

All communications should be archived here for reference and continuity.
