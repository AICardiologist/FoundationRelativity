# Option 2 Implementation - Final Status

## ❌ NOT COMPLETE

### What Works
- Found correct lemmas: `Submodule.mkQ`, `Submodule.mkQ_apply`, `Submodule.Quotient.norm_mk_le`, `Submodule.Quotient.mk_eq_zero`
- Overall mathematical structure is sound

### What Doesn't Work
- **QuotSeparation.lean**: Does NOT compile
  - Line 36: Type mismatch in q construction
  - Line 50: Failed to synthesize NormedAddCommGroup instance
  - Line 53: Type mismatch for NormedSpace instance
  - 3 sorrys remain

- **SimpleFacts.lean**: Compiles but has 2 sorrys
  - Cocompact filter contradiction not resolved
  - Separation bound calculation incomplete

- **WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean**: Missing entirely (no working version)

### Remaining Sorrys Count
- QuotSeparation.lean: 3 sorrys + doesn't compile
- SimpleFacts.lean: 2 sorrys
- WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean: Missing
- **Total: 5+ sorrys and compilation failures**

### Blockers
1. Cannot construct q : E →L[ℝ] E ⧸ Scl properly
2. Instance resolution for quotient spaces failing
3. No working connection to bidual gap theorem

## Verdict
Option 2 is **NOT functional**. The implementation has correct ideas but critical compilation failures prevent it from being a working proof.
