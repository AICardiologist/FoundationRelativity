# Paper 2: Release Notes v0.2

## Release Version: p2-crm-v0.2

### Date: September 2025

## Overview

This release represents a major revision of the Paper 2 formalization following community feedback and improved understanding of Constructive Reverse Mathematics (CRM) methodology. The core equivalence theorem (bidual gap ↔ WLPO) remains intact with 0 sorries, while the axiom hygiene has been significantly improved.

## Major Changes Since v0.1

### 1. CRM Methodology Compliance
- **Meta-classical separation**: Clear distinction between classical metatheory and constructive consumer
- **Axiom hygiene**: Proper fencing of classical reasoning in the Gap → WLPO direction
- **Ishihara kernel**: Refined to be purely at the Prop level, avoiding computational overhead

### 2. Structural Improvements
- **New directory**: `CRM_MetaClassical/` containing the meta-classical components
  - `Ishihara.lean`: Core kernel infrastructure
  - `OpNormCore.lean`: Operator norm foundations
- **Improved proof architecture**: More robust δ-gap construction using `δ := |y(h⋆)|/2`
- **Enhanced modularity**: Better separation between constructive and classical components

### 3. Documentation Updates
- **LaTeX paper**: `documentation/paper-v5.tex` updated with:
  - Meta-classical qualifier in abstract
  - Improved WLPO → Gap proof sketch with coding approach
  - Fixed finite Hahn-Banach theorem statement
  - Added Stone window algebraic structure definition
  - New bibliography entries (Brown-Simpson 1986, Diener CRM survey, Ishihara 1990)
- **README**: Updated with current status and CRM methodology notes

## Build Status

### Main Theorem
```bash
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.gap_equiv_wlpo
```
- **Status**: ✅ Complete (0 sorries)
- **Axioms**: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (used only in Gap → WLPO direction)

### Core Modules (0 sorries each)
- `Core/HBExact.lean`: Finite Hahn-Banach
- `Core/Kernel.lean`: Ishihara kernel infrastructure  
- `Bidual/*.lean`: Full bidual space theory
- `HB/Gap_to_WLPO_pure.lean`: Gap → WLPO direction
- `HB/WLPO_to_Gap_pure.lean`: WLPO → Gap core
- `HB/DirectDual.lean`: c₀ witness construction

### Optional Completeness (3 WLPO-conditional sorries)
- `HB/WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean`: Contains 3 sorries for optional completeness lemmas

## Technical Innovations

1. **Prop-level Ishihara kernel**: Avoids computational overhead while maintaining constructive validity
2. **Concrete δ-gap parameter**: Uses `δ := |y(h⋆)|/2` avoiding bidual norm type inference issues
3. **Robust csSup approach**: Direct suprema handling without fragile instance resolution
4. **CRM-compliant construction**: Proper separation of classical and constructive reasoning

## Acknowledgments

This revision benefited from discussions in the Lean Zulip community regarding CRM methodology and axiom hygiene. The formalization was developed with assistance from multi-AI agents as part of a case study in AI-assisted formal mathematics.

## Known Issues

- Three WLPO-conditional sorries remain in optional completeness module (not affecting main theorem)
- The ℓ∞/c₀ separation requires classical choice (as expected for CRM)

## Future Work

- Upstream contributions to mathlib4 (Ishihara kernel, bidual theory, HasWLPO typeclass)
- Further refinement of constructive/classical separation
- Investigation of alternative witness spaces
