# CReal Infrastructure - Obsolete (August 9, 2025)

## ⚠️ This directory is OBSOLETE

This directory contains the complex constructive real number infrastructure that was **bypassed by the axiom-clean breakthrough** on August 9, 2025.

## Why This Became Obsolete

### **Original Approach** (Pre-Breakthrough)
- Complex constructive real arithmetic framework
- Quotient operations and modulus arithmetic  
- Multiple layers of infrastructure dependencies
- **22 sorries** across multiple files
- Technical challenges: Lean 4 timeouts, universe metavariables, API fragility

### **Breakthrough Approach** (Direct Prop-Level)
- Direct theorem `WLPO_of_gap : BidualGapStrong → WLPO`
- No constructive infrastructure needed
- Uses standard functional analysis (approximate supremum selection)
- **0 sorries** and axiom-clean
- Robust across mathlib versions

## Files in This Directory

- `Basic.lean` - Constructive real number definitions (1 sorry)
- `Quotient.lean` - Quotient operations for CReal (7 sorries)  
- `Completeness.lean` - Completeness theorems (6 sorries)
- `Multiplication.lean` - CReal multiplication (8 sorries)

**Total**: 22 sorries that are no longer needed for the core proof.

## Historical Value

These files preserve:
1. **Technical expertise** - Deep constructive analysis techniques
2. **Implementation lessons** - Complex Lean 4 infrastructure patterns
3. **Mathematical development** - Evolution from complex to simple solutions
4. **Research documentation** - What approaches were attempted and why

## Current Implementation

The axiom-clean proof is now in:
- **`../Ishihara.lean`** - Direct Prop-level theorem (0 sorries, axiom-clean)

This demonstrates that mathematical insight can often achieve more than engineering complexity.
