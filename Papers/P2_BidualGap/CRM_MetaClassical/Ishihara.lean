# The Ishihara Kernel and its implication to WLPO

This file defines the `IshiharaKernel` structure, which captures the necessary
properties of a "witness" object extracted from a classical theorem about bidual gaps.

The main result is `WLPO_of_kernel`, a purely constructive proof that the
existence of such a kernel implies the Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience (WLPO).
This serves as the "constructive consumer" in our producer/consumer architecture.

## CRM methodology implementation:
• **Classical producer** (fenced in `section ClassicalMeta`):
  - Extracts y ∈ X** \ j(X) using classical choice
  - Finds h⋆ ∈ X* with (‖y‖/2) < ‖y h⋆‖ via approximate supremum selection
  - Defines g(α) using a global case-split on the undecidable predicate (∀ n, α n = false)
  - Computes the gap parameter δ := ‖y h⋆‖ / 2 > 0 using only order facts on ℝ
  
• **Constructive consumer**:
  - The kernel (y, f, g, δ) is processed by `WLPO_of_kernel`
  - This proof is fully intuitionistic (no classical axioms)
  - No undecidable case-splits occur outside ClassicalMeta

## Implementation details:
- **Tactic choices**: We avoid fragile normalization/`gcongr` tactics in favor of explicit inequalities
- **Norm handling**: Operator norm existence is proven in `OpNormCore` and used only in classical sections
- **Universe management**: The `KernelWitness` structure avoids universe polymorphism issues
- **Proof structure**: The consumer proof uses simple case analysis on the dichotomy property

## Axiom usage:
- `WLPO_of_kernel`: No axioms (fully constructive)
- `kernel_from_gap`: Uses `Classical.choice` and `propext` (meta-classical)

A structure representing an Ishihara kernel. This is a mathematical object
that acts as a "logical oracle," encoding the answer to a WLPO-style
undecidable question into the structure of a Banach space functional.

It consists of:
- `y`: A bidual functional (the witness extracted from the gap)
- `f`, `g`: Functionals used to "probe" y and extract logical information
- `δ`: A positive constant ensuring definite separation from zero
- `sep`: A proof of the key dichotomy property (either exactly 0 or at least δ)
- `zero_iff_allFalse`: A proof that the probe result corresponds to the logical property

This structure is designed to be constructive: all fields can be reasoned about
without classical axioms once the structure is instantiated.

/--
The existence of an Ishihara kernel implies WLPO.

This is the "constructive consumer" part of the main theorem. The proof
proceeds by case analysis on the `sep` property of the kernel, which gives
us a decidable dichotomy that we can leverage constructively.

**Proof strategy:**
1. Apply the separation property to get |y(f + g α)| = 0 ∨ δ ≤ |y(f + g α)|
2. In the first case: Use zero_iff_allFalse to conclude (∀ n, α n = false)
3. In the second case: Show y(f + g α) ≠ 0, hence ¬(∀ n, α n = false)

**Implementation notes:**
- The proof is fully constructive (no classical axioms)
- We use basic order reasoning on reals to connect the cases
- The key insight is that the dichotomy property provides enough information
  to decide the WLPO question without actually computing α

Helper lemma for approximate supremum selection.

Given a nonzero bounded linear functional T, we can find a unit vector x
such that |T(x)| > ‖T‖/2. This is a classical result that doesn't require
compactness of the unit ball (which would fail in infinite dimensions).

**Implementation notes:**
- We use classical logic to perform the proof by contradiction
- The scaling argument is explicit to avoid normalization issues
- This lemma is only used in the classical producer section

Implementation checklist (forward direction):
1. From `BidualGapStrong`, unpack `X`, the canonical `j`, and `¬ surj j`.
2. Build the testers `(x_n)` and weights `(w_n)` that feed the encoding.
3. Define `encode α := ∑ n, w_n · x_n(α)` (summable series in `X`).
4. Show the separation: from the gap element `y ∈ X** \ j(X)`, obtain `δ > 0`
   and prove `|y(encode α)| ∈ {0} ∪ [δ, ∞)`, so `‖·‖`-threshold decides WLPO.
5. Hand the kernel to `WLPO_of_witness` (already universe-safe) to finish.

Notes:
- The "sum" is a Banach-space series; rely only on completeness of `X`.
- No global instances, keep every construction Prop-level or local.
- For the δ-gap, follow the professor's guidance: the key use of "dual is Banach"
  is to ensure sums of normable functionals remain normable (bounded with LUB).
