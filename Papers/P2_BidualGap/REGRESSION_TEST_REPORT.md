# Regression Test Report

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Branch**: main  
**Commit**: After roadmap v4.0 implementation

## Test Results: ✅ ALL PASS

### Core Functionality Tests

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Main theorem `gap_equiv_wlpo` | ✅ | Type checks correctly as `BidualGapStrong ↔ WLPO` |
| DirectDual.lean | ✅ | Builds with 0 sorries |
| WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean | ✅ | Main theorem file works |
| Basic.lean definitions | ✅ | All core definitions accessible |
| Quotient framework | ✅ | Builds successfully |
| Indicator/C0Spec/Iota | ✅ | Supporting modules all compile |

### Code Quality Checks

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Sorries in HB/ | ✅ | 0 sorries (except DualIsometries skeleton) |
| Axiom profile | ✅ | 2 placeholder axioms as expected |
| Import structure | ✅ | All dependencies resolve correctly |

### Axiom Profile

The main theorem currently depends on:
- Standard axioms: `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`
- Placeholder axioms (to be removed):
  - `dual_is_banach_c0_from_WLPO`
  - `dual_is_banach_c0_dual_from_WLPO`

### New Additions

**DualIsometries.lean**: Created with complete skeletons for:
- `(c₀ →L[ℝ] ℝ) ≃ₗᵢ lp 1` isometry
- `(lp 1 →L[ℝ] ℝ) ≃ₗᵢ lp ∞` isometry
- Placeholder proofs to discharge both axioms

**Documentation**: Enhanced DualIsBanach explanation in Basic.lean with constructive content clarification.

## Summary

All regression tests pass. The codebase is stable after the roadmap v4.0 refactoring. The skeleton for axiom removal is in place and ready for implementation per the milestones in ROADMAP-v4.0.md.

## Next Steps

Following the roadmap milestones:
1. Implement `toCoeffs` and prove summability (Milestone A1)
2. Implement `ofCoeffs` with norm equality (Milestone A2)
3. Complete `dual_c0_iso_l1` isometry
4. Discharge first axiom using the isometry
