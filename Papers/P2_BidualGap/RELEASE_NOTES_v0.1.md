# Release Notes: p2-minimal-v0.1

## Paper 2 Minimal Reproducible Build

### üéØ Highlights

- **Option-B Core** (dependency-free, sorry-free) proving the abstract bridge:
  ```lean
  HasNonzeroQuotFunctional Q + QuotToGapBridge X Q DX ‚áí GapX DX
  ```
- **Minimal build target** `Papers.P2_BidualGap.P2_Minimal` compiles in CI with 0 errors
- **Instances module** shows end-to-end wiring with dummy types
- **Standalone subproject** builds independently with Lean v4.8.0
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automatic sorry-free verification

### üì¶ What's Included

#### Core Files (Sorry-Free)
- `HB/OptionB/CorePure.lean` - Abstract Option-B interface (0 dependencies)
- `HB/OptionB/Instances.lean` - End-to-end demonstration with dummy types
- `HB/OptionB/standalone/` - Independent build environment

#### Build Infrastructure
- `P2_Minimal.lean` - Clean build target for CI
- `.github/workflows/p2-minimal.yml` - Automated CI workflow
- `scripts/no_sorry_p2_minimal.sh` - Sorry-free verification script
- `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` - Full build instructions

### üöß What's Not in This Tag

- **Mathlib-based full build** (`P2_Full`) - Provided as dev skeleton; requires toolchain alignment
- **Classical ‚Ñì‚àû/c‚ÇÄ instance** - Provided as skeleton in `ClassicalInstances.lean`, clearly labeled classical (not WLPO)
- **WIP files** - Isolated in `Papers/P2_BidualGap/WIP/` directory

### üîß Reproduce

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationRelativity/FoundationRelativity.git
cd FoundationRelativity
git checkout p2-minimal-v0.1
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.P2_Minimal
```

### üìä Build Statistics

- **Build time**: ~30 seconds (minimal target)
- **Sorries**: 0 in Option-B core
- **Dependencies**: None (pure Lean 4)
- **Toolchain**: `leanprover/lean4:v4.23.0-rc2`

### üî¨ Mathematical Content

The Option-B architecture provides a modular separation between:

1. **Logical assumptions** (WLPO or classical choice)
2. **Functional analytic bridge** (quotient functional to bidual gap)
3. **Combination theorem** (instance-based composition)

This design allows different foundational assumptions to be plugged in without modifying the core bridge theorem.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The ‚Ñì‚àû/c‚ÇÄ instantiation requires classical choice (e.g., Banach limit), not just WLPO
- The c‚ÇÄ witness for Paper 2's main result is in the full build (requires toolchain alignment)
- This minimal artifact demonstrates the architecture works end-to-end

### üôè Acknowledgments

Development assisted by:
- Gemini 2.5 Deep Think (architecture exploration)
- GPT-5 Pro (Lean scaffolding)
- Claude Code (repository management)

All proofs verified by Lean 4; LLM outputs reviewed and validated by humans.
