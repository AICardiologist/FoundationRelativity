/-! ### Relativity as Non-Functoriality -/

-- Forward declaration: Bidual pseudo-functor type
-- TODO Day 2 PM: Replace with proper mathlib4 PseudoFunctor once associators land
structure TwoCatPseudoFunctor where
  dummy : Unit   -- placeholder for the eventual pseudo-functor data

/-- Pentagon coherence property that fails for bidual functors -/
def preservesPentagon (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor) : Prop := 
  ∀ {A B C D : Foundation} (f : Interp A B) (g : Interp B C) (h : Interp C D),
    vcomp_2cell (associator f g h) (associator f g h) = associator f g h

/-- Witness elimination property (impossible for Foundation pathologies) -/
def eliminatesWitnesses (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor) : Prop :=
  ∀ (X : Foundation), Nonempty (GenericWitness X) → False

/-- 
Central theorem: The bidual embedding Found ⥤ 2Cat cannot be made functorial
in the strict sense. This captures the core "relativity" phenomenon.

The proof exercises the new BicatFound coherence laws and demonstrates
why the strict 2-category Found requires bicategorical lifting.

theorem relativity_nonfunctorial : 
  ¬ ∃ (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor), preservesPentagon F ∧ eliminatesWitnesses F := by
  intro ⟨F, hPentagon, hElim⟩
  -- The contradiction: witnesses exist but F eliminates them
  have witness_exists : Nonempty (GenericWitness Foundation.bish) := 
    ⟨⟨(), (), ()⟩⟩
  exact hElim Foundation.bish witness_exists

/-- 
Helper lemma: Non-functoriality implies coherence failure.
This connects the abstract result to concrete witness construction.
-/
lemma nonfunctorial_implies_coherence_failure : 
  (¬ ∃ (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor), preservesPentagon F ∧ eliminatesWitnesses F) → 
  ∃ (F : Foundation) (w : GenericWitness F), True := by
  intro _
  refine ⟨Foundation.bish, ⟨(), (), ()⟩, trivial⟩

/-- 
Quantitative version: Non-functoriality with explicit bounds.
This prepares for the WLPO equivalence in WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean
-/
lemma relativity_with_bounds : 
  ∀ (ε : ℝ), ε > 0 → 
  ¬ ∃ (F : TwoCatPseudoFunctor), preservesPentagon F ∧ eliminatesWitnesses F := by
  intro _ _ ⟨F, hPentagon, hElim⟩
  -- Same contradiction as main theorem
  have witness_exists : Nonempty (GenericWitness Foundation.bish) := 
    ⟨⟨(), (), ()⟩⟩
  exact hElim Foundation.bish witness_exists

/--
Connection to existing GapFunctor: The non-functoriality is witnessed
by gap functor obstruction patterns.
