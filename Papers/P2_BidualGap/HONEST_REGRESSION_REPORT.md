# HONEST Regression Test Report

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Purpose**: Full disclosure of ALL issues found

## Executive Summary

The main theorem and core proofs work perfectly. However, there are orphaned files that don't compile, and one import issue was found and fixed.

## ✅ WORKING Components

### Main Theorem Chain
- `HB/WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean` - Builds successfully
- `HB/DirectDual.lean` - Builds successfully  
- `Constructive/Ishihara.lean` - Builds successfully
- `Constructive/DualStructure.lean` - Builds successfully
- `Basic.lean` - Builds successfully

### Quotient Framework
- All Gap/*.lean files build successfully
- All test files (*Tests.lean) pass

### Test Results
- Main theorem `gap_equiv_wlpo` type-checks correctly
- All 7 test files compile and pass
- No errors in active proof chain

## ⚠️ ISSUES Found

### 1. Fixed: DualIsometries.lean Import Error
**Problem**: Wrong import path `Mathlib.Analysis.NormedSpace.lpSpace`  
**Solution**: Changed to `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Lp.lpSpace`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. Orphaned Files (Not Used, Don't Compile)

These files exist but are NOT imported by any active proof:

| File | Issue | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| `Logic/WLPOBasic.lean` | olean not built | None - not imported |
| `Tactics.lean` | olean not built | None - not imported |
| `SmokeTest.lean` | olean not built | None - not imported |
| `RelativityNonFunc.lean` | olean not built | None - not imported |
| `WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean` | olean not built | None - old stub |
| `CReal_obsolete/*.lean` | olean not built | None - obsolete |

**Why they don't matter**: These files are not part of the dependency chain for the main theorem. They appear to be old experiments or abandoned approaches.

### 3. Linter Warnings (Non-Critical)

Several files have linter warnings:
- Unused variables
- "Use simp instead of simpa" suggestions
- Unused simp arguments

These don't affect correctness but should be cleaned up.

## Critical Path Status

The critical path for the main theorem is:
```
Basic.lean
  ↓
Constructive/DualStructure.lean (definitions only)
  ↓
Constructive/Ishihara.lean
  ↓
HB/SimpleFacts.lean + HB/DirectDual.lean
  ↓
HB/WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean (main theorem)
```

**All files in this chain compile successfully.**

## Build Performance

- Main components take 2-3 minutes to build
- Some builds timeout after 5 minutes (but succeed when run individually)
- Mathlib dependencies are properly cached

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
- [x] DualIsometries.lean import (ALREADY FIXED)

### Should Clean
- [ ] Remove orphaned files or move to old_file_last_print/
- [ ] Fix linter warnings in DirectDual.lean
- [ ] Fix linter warnings in Ishihara.lean

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Document why orphaned files exist
- [ ] Add CI check to prevent orphaned files

## Conclusion

**The core Paper 2 formalization is solid.** The main theorem works, all tests pass, and the only real issue (DualIsometries import) has been fixed. The orphaned files are technical debt but don't affect the proof.
