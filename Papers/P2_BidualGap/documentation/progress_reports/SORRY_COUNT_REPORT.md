# Paper 2 Sorry Count and Compilation Report

Date: 2025-08-04

## Summary
- **Total sorries across all Paper 2 files**: 104
- **Core working files**: 7 sorries (compile successfully)
- **Constructive framework**: ~97 sorries (some compilation issues)

## Core Working Files (Compile ✓)

| File | Sorries | Status | Purpose |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| Basic.lean | 1 | ✓ Compiles | WLPO definition, BidualGap placeholder |
| Logic/WLPOBasic.lean | 0 | ✓ Compiles | Clean WLPO definition |
| MainTheoremSimple.lean | 2 | ✓ Compiles | Main theorem statement |
| WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean | 4 | ✓ Compiles | Core equivalence structure |
| **Subtotal** | **7** | | |

## Constructive Framework Files

### Recently Created (Following Senior Prof)
| File | Sorries | Status | Purpose |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| RegularReal.lean | 5 | ❌ Minor syntax | Fixed modulus reals |
| WitnessSimple.lean | 6 | ? Not tested | Unnormalized witness |
| HahnBanachOneStep.lean | 9 | ? Not tested | One-step extension |
| WLPO_ASP_Equivalence.lean | 6 | ? Not tested | Core equivalence |

### Original Constructive Files
| File | Sorries | Status | Purpose |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| CReal.lean | 1 | ❌ Import issues | Original CReal attempt |
| Sequences.lean | 9 | ❌ Depends on CReal | ℓ∞ and c₀ spaces |
| MonotoneConvergence.lean | 9 | ❌ Depends on CReal | Limit constructions |
| HahnBanach.lean | 9 | ❌ Depends on CReal | Original HB attempt |
| NormedSpace.lean | 4 | ❌ Depends on CReal | Constructive norms |
| MainTheorem.lean | 4 | ❌ Depends on all | Full theorem |
| WitnessRational.lean | 1 | ❌ Syntax errors | Rational witness |

### Other Files
| File | Sorries | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|
| Analysis/BanachDual.lean | 4 | Classical comparison |
| Logic/WLPO.lean | 3 | Extended WLPO theory |
| Various experimental files | ~20 | WLPO_ASP.lean, etc. |

## Compilation Status

### ✅ What Compiles Now
```bash
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.Basic
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.Logic.WLPOBasic  
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.MainTheoremSimple
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.WLPO_Equiv_Gap
```

### ❌ What Doesn't Compile
- Most constructive framework files have dependencies or syntax issues
- Original CReal framework has import path problems
- New RegularReal has minor syntax issue (fixed above)

## Analysis

1. **Core theorem statement works**: The 7 sorries in working files represent the actual theorem and its immediate dependencies.

2. **Constructive framework in flux**: Following senior professor's guidance, we're transitioning from CReal to RegularReal, which explains the duplication and high sorry count.

3. **Many experimental files**: Several attempts at WLPO_ASP equivalence contribute to the count.

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on core working files**: These 7 sorries are the critical ones
2. **Complete RegularReal transition**: Fix syntax and complete the new framework
3. **Archive old attempts**: Move failed CReal attempts to deprecated/
4. **Consolidate WLPO_ASP files**: Pick best approach and remove others

## Path to Target (≤5 sorries)

From current 7 in working files:
- Basic.lean (1): Keep as placeholder for now
- MainTheoremSimple.lean (2): These are the main proof obligations
- WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean (4): Can reduce by importing constructive proofs

Target achievable by:
1. Completing WLPO ↔ ASP equivalence (eliminates 2 sorries)
2. Importing witness construction (eliminates 1-2 sorries)
3. Keeping only essential placeholders
