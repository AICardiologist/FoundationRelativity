# Progress Report: Post Senior Professor Feedback

## Actions Completed ✓

### 1. WLPO Definition Fixed
- Corrected in `Basic.lean` to actual logical proposition
- No more Unit placeholders or sorries

### 2. Honest Status Documentation
- Created `FORMALIZATION_STATUS.md` showing real sorry count
- Documents removal of Unit tricks
- Shows 59 honest sorries vs previous fraudulent "0 sorries"

### 3. Started Regular Real Implementation
- Created `RegularReal.lean` with fixed modulus 2^{-n}
- Basic arithmetic operations defined
- Multiplication simplified but needs completion

### 4. Simplified Witness Sequence
- Created `WitnessSimple.lean` with unnormalized sequence
- v^α_n = ∑_{k=0}^n α_k (no division)
- Key discreteness property identified

### 5. One-Step Hahn-Banach Framework
- Created `HahnBanachOneStep.lean`
- Focuses on Y → Y + span(x) extension
- Shows where ASP is needed

## Current State of Key Components

### RegularReal.lean
```lean
-- Fixed modulus definition
|seq n - seq m| ≤ 2^(-n : ℤ) + 2^(-m : ℤ)
```
- ✓ Structure defined
- ✓ Addition works
- ⚠️ Multiplication needs boundedness completion
- ⚠️ Comparison operators needed

### WitnessSimple.lean
```lean
-- Unnormalized sequence
witness_simple α n = ∑_{k=0}^n (if α k then 1 else 0)
```
- ✓ Main theorem structure
- ✓ Discreteness property stated
- ⚠️ Induction proofs needed

### HahnBanachOneStep.lean
- ✓ One-step extension framework
- ✓ Shows ASP requirement clearly
- ⚠️ Need to connect ASP to finding extension value
- ⚠️ Need located distance for c₀

## Key Insights Gained

1. **Regular reals dramatically simplify proofs** - The fixed modulus makes multiplication tractable
2. **Unnormalized witness is cleaner** - Discrete values (0 or ≥1) make convergence analysis simpler  
3. **One-step suffices** - Don't need full Zorn's lemma machinery

## Remaining High Priority Tasks

1. **Complete ASP ↔ WLPO equivalence**
   - This is the core logical equivalence
   - Should be in WLPO_ASP_Core.lean

2. **Finish RegularReal arithmetic**
   - Complete multiplication boundedness
   - Add ordering/comparison

3. **Prove c₀ is located**
   - Use MCT on tail suprema
   - Connect to distance function

4. **Complete witness sequence proofs**
   - Finish discreteness induction
   - Link to c₀ membership

5. **Integrate into main theorem**
   - Forward: Gap → witness → WLPO
   - Reverse: WLPO → ASP → HB → Gap

## Success Metrics (from Senior Professor)

| Component | Target | Current Status |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| CReal arithmetic | No sorry | ~3 sorries |
| WLPO ↔ ASP | No sorry | Not started |
| Hahn-Banach c₀/ℓ∞ | ≤5 sorries | Framework only |
| Main theorem | No sorry | Structure only |

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Complete `ASP ↔ WLPO` equivalence proof
2. Finish `RegularReal` multiplication using boundedness
3. Complete `witness_simple` discreteness proof
4. Connect ASP to one-step extension value selection

The path is clear and we're making solid progress on the genuine constructive content.
