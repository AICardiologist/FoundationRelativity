# Paper 2 Compilation Status

Last Updated: 2025-08-04

## Files That Compile ✓

### Core Files
- `Papers.P2_BidualGap.Basic` - Basic definitions (with 2 sorries)
- `Papers.P2_BidualGap.Logic.WLPOBasic` - WLPO definition
- `Papers.P2_BidualGap.MainTheoremSimple` - Main theorem statement (2 sorries)
- `Papers.P2_BidualGap.Tactics` - Custom tactics
- `Papers.P2_BidualGap.WLPO_Equiv_Gap` - Core equivalence structure
- `Papers.P2_BidualGap.SmokeTest` - Basic verification

### Working Components
1. **WLPO Definition**: Binary sequences and the basic principle
2. **Main Theorem Statement**: Bidual Gap ↔ WLPO (with sorries for the proof)
3. **Basic Structure**: The theorem statement correctly expresses the equivalence
4. **Unit/() Tricks Removed**: All cheats have been exposed and eliminated

## Files With Issues ✗

### Constructive Framework
- `CReal.lean` - Import issues with Mathlib modules
- `WLPO_ASP_Core.lean` - Depends on CReal
- `Sequences.lean` - Depends on CReal
- `MainTheorem.lean` (full version) - Complex dependencies

### Issues to Fix
1. **Mathlib Imports**: Need to find correct import paths for:
   - Rational number ordering
   - Ring lemmas
   - Order lemmas

2. **Type Class Instances**: Several files have issues with:
   - Instance resolution
   - Implicit vs explicit arguments

## Compilation Commands

To build the working core:
```bash
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.Basic
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.Logic.WLPOBasic  
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.MainTheoremSimple
```

## Summary

- **Working Files**: 6 files compile successfully with 4 total sorries
- **Constructive Framework**: ~55 sorries in progress, needs import fixes
- **Key Achievement**: Removed all Unit/() tricks and false "0 sorry" claims
- **Current Focus**: Implementing junior professor's guidance on rational arithmetic for witness sequences

The essential theorem statement and WLPO definition compile correctly. The constructive framework genuinely captures the constructive content rather than using Unit tricks.
