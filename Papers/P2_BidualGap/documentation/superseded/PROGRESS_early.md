# Paper 2 Progress Report

## Completed Foundation (✓)

### 1. Constructive Real Numbers
- `CReal` as Cauchy sequences with explicit modulus
- Basic operations: addition, negation, multiplication
- Equivalence relation (setoid structure)
- No trichotomy or decidable ordering

### 2. Constructive Normed Spaces  
- `CNormedSpace` without classical axioms
- Continuous linear maps with explicit bounds
- Dual and bidual space definitions
- Canonical embedding (with sorries for properties)

### 3. Sequence Spaces
- `ell_infty` as bounded sequences
- `c_zero` as sequences converging to 0
- Witness sequence construction for WLPO
- Located property framework

### 4. Monotone Convergence
- Monotone bounded sequences converge
- Limit superior exists constructively
- Key for proving c₀ is located in ℓ∞

## Critical Next Steps

### 1. WLPO ↔ ASP Equivalence (High Priority)
This is the bridge between logic and analysis. We need:
- Formal definition of ASP in terms of CReal
- Proof that WLPO → ASP (enables Hahn-Banach)
- Proof that ASP → WLPO (via sequence construction)

### 2. Complete Locatedness Proof
- Finish showing c₀ is located via limsup
- Prove in_c_zero_iff_limsup_zero
- Complete distance approximation

### 3. Constructive Hahn-Banach
- For located subspaces with ASP
- Extension of Banach limit from c to ℓ∞
- Explicit norm preservation

### 4. Main Theorem Assembly
- SHB → WLPO (via witness sequence)
- WLPO → Gap (via Hahn-Banach extension)
- Complete bidual gap characterization

## Technical Debt

### Must Fix Before Main Theorem:
1. CReal multiplication Cauchy proof
2. Absolute value construction (subtle!)
3. Supremum construction with ASP
4. Norm definition for ℓ∞

### Can Defer:
1. Full algebraic structure proofs
2. Completeness of CNormedSpace
3. General continuous linear map theory

## Key Insight from Consultant

The sequence-dependent construction (v^α) proves **Gap → WLPO**, not the reverse. The **WLPO → Gap** direction uses WLPO globally via ASP to enable Hahn-Banach.

## Estimated Timeline

- Week 1: Complete WLPO ↔ ASP and locatedness
- Week 2: Constructive Hahn-Banach theorem
- Week 3: Assemble main theorem with both directions
- Week 4: Fill technical debt and polish

The constructive framework is now solid. The main mathematical work ahead is formalizing the bridge between logical principles (WLPO/ASP) and analytical constructions (Hahn-Banach).
