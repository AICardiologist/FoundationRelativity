# Paper 2 Progress Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Exposed and Removed Unit/() Tricks
- Discovered Papers 2-3 were using `Unit` type to claim "0 sorries"
- Completely removed all such tricks
- Now have honest `sorry` markers for incomplete proofs

### 2. Core Files Compile Successfully
- `Basic.lean` - Basic definitions (2 sorries)
- `Logic/WLPOBasic.lean` - WLPO definition (0 sorries)
- `MainTheoremSimple.lean` - Main theorem statement (2 sorries) 
- `Tactics.lean` - Custom tactics (0 sorries)
- `WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean` - Core equivalence (0 sorries)
- **Total: 4 sorries in working files**

### 3. Constructive Framework Implementation
Following junior professor's detailed blueprint:
- Implemented CReal with explicit modulus of convergence
- Added Modulus.mono for monotone hull construction
- Created witness sequence with rational arithmetic helpers
- Implemented gap encoding (0 vs â‰¥1/2) for decidability

### 4. Documentation
- Updated README with current status
- Created compilation status document
- Prepared questions for professors
- Documented all changes and rationale

## Current State

### Working
- Main theorem statement compiles
- WLPO definition is clean
- Basic framework is solid
- No more Unit/() tricks

### In Progress (Constructive Framework)
- CReal arithmetic (~10 sorries)
- Witness sequence convergence (~15 sorries)
- Hahn-Banach construction (~20 sorries)
- Monotone convergence (~10 sorries)
- **Total: ~55 sorries**

### Blockers
1. Mathlib import paths for rational ordering
2. CReal comparison complexity
3. Located distance implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Await professor responses** on:
   - Import path fixes
   - Simplification strategies
   - Priority guidance

2. **Continue witness sequence** work:
   - Complete rational arithmetic approach
   - Simplify CReal comparisons
   - Fill in convergence details

3. **Fix CReal.lean** compilation:
   - Resolve import issues
   - Complete abs_add proof
   - Fix multiplication modulus

## Key Insight

The move from fake "0 sorries" with Unit tricks to honest "55 sorries" with real constructive content represents genuine mathematical progress. We now have a framework that actually engages with the constructive challenges rather than avoiding them.
