## Priority Order (Time-boxed)

### Week 1 Priority
1. **Complete ASP â†” WLPO** - This unlocks everything else
2. **Finish RegularReal basics** - Needed for all proofs
3. **Complete witness discreteness** - Simple inductions

### Week 2 Priority  
4. **One-step HB with ASP** - Core construction
5. **Located distance** - Uses MCT
6. **Main theorem assembly** - Put it all together

### Week 3-4 Buffer
- Polish remaining sorries
- Add benchmark comparisons
- Documentation

## Key Technical Insights

1. **Gap encoding trick**: Use {0} âˆª {1 - 1/(n+2) : Î± n = true}
   - Ensures gap between 0 and other elements
   - Makes supremum decision possible

2. **Regular real benefits**:
   - Fixed modulus 2^{-n} simplifies everything
   - Multiplication just needs boundedness
   - Completeness is straightforward

3. **Witness simplification**:
   - Unnormalized avoids division
   - Discrete values (naturals) simplify analysis
   - Direct connection to WLPO

## Blocking Issues

1. Need to complete ASP â†” WLPO for HB to work
2. Need basic RegularReal arithmetic for everything
3. Need located distance to construct the gap

## Next Immediate Action

Complete the gap encoding supremum decision in `WLPO_ASP_Equivalence.lean`. This is the linchpin that makes everything else work.
