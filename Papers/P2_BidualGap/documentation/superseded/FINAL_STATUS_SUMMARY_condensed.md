# Paper 2 Final Status Summary

Date: 2025-08-04

## Executive Summary

✅ **Core Paper 2 files compile successfully without modification**
- Basic.lean, WLPOBasic.lean, MainTheoremSimple.lean all build cleanly
- Main theorem statement is properly formulated with correct WLPO definition
- No Unit tricks remain in working files
- CReal.lean fixed and now compiles (was broken before)

## Sorry Count

### Working Files (What Actually Matters)
- **Basic.lean**: 1 sorry (BidualGap placeholder)
- **Logic/WLPOBasic.lean**: 0 sorries ✓
- **MainTheoremSimple.lean**: 2 sorries (theorem directions)
- **WLPO_Equiv_Gap.lean**: 4 sorries
- **Total in working files**: 7 sorries

### Constructive Framework (Work in Progress)
- ~107 sorries across experimental implementations
- Multiple attempts at CReal, RegularReal, witness sequences
- These are research/development files, not the core theorem
- CReal.lean: 10 sorries (now compiles after fixes)

### Total Repository
- 114 sorries across all Paper 2 files (updated count)
- Most are in experimental/development files
- CReal.lean now compiles with 10 sorries

## Key Achievements

1. **WLPO Properly Defined**
   ```lean
   def WLPO : Prop := ∀ (α : BinarySeq), (∀ n, α n = false) ∨ ¬(∀ n, α n = false)
   ```

2. **Main Theorem Statement Clear**
   ```lean
   theorem bidual_gap_iff_wlpo : 
     (∃ (E : Type) (h1 : NormedAddCommGroup E) (h2 : NormedSpace ℝ E) (h3 : CompleteSpace E), 
       HasBidualGap E h1 h2) ↔ WLPO
   ```

3. **Unit Tricks Eliminated**
   - Previous "0 sorries" based on Unit placeholders removed
   - Now have honest sorry markers for real mathematical work

## Path Forward

### To Reach ≤5 Sorries Target
1. Complete WLPO ↔ ASP equivalence (eliminates 2 sorries)
2. Import witness construction (eliminates 1-2 sorries)
3. Focus on core theorem directions in MainTheoremSimple

### Technical Priorities (Per Senior Professor)
1. Implement regular reals with fixed modulus
2. Use unnormalized witness sequence
3. One-step Hahn-Banach extension
4. Prove c₀ is located using MCT

## Compilation Instructions

To build and verify Paper 2 core files:
```bash
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.Basic
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.Logic.WLPOBasic  
lake build Papers.P2_BidualGap.MainTheoremSimple
```

All compile successfully with total of 3 sorries in these core files.

## Conclusion

Paper 2 is in good shape:
- Core theorem compiles and is properly stated
- WLPO definition is correct (no Unit tricks)
- Clear path to completion following senior professor's guidance
- 7 sorries in working files is honest progress from fraudulent "0 sorries"
