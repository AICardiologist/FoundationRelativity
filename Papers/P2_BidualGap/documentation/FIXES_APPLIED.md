# LaTeX Fixes Applied to paper-v5.tex

## Summary
Applied all critical fixes to ensure LaTeX compilation and correctness of Lean snippets.

## Fixes Applied

### A. Compile Blocker Fixed ✅
- **A1**: Added `\newenvironment{defi}{\begin{definition}}{\end{definition}}` alias

### B. Consistency Fixes ✅
- **B1**: Changed `J` to `J_{\linf}` in two locations:
  - Main Theorem definition
  - Introduction paragraph about ZFC
- **B2**: Fixed undefined appendix reference - changed to "(see the repository)"
- **B3**: Replaced `\usepackage{color}` with `\usepackage[x11names,table]{xcolor}`

### C. Lean Snippet Corrections ✅
- **C1**: Fixed Producer push_neg step:
  - Added proper rewriting of Surjective to ∀∃-shape before push_neg
  - Now correctly transforms `¬ Function.Surjective j` step by step
  
- **C2**: Fixed Producer separation inequality proof:
  - Replaced fragile `le_of_eq rfl` with proper half_le_self inequality
  - Added norm_nonneg and Real.norm_eq_abs steps
  - More robust across mathlib versions

## Result
The document should now:
1. Compile without errors
2. Use consistent notation throughout
3. Have correct, verifiable Lean code snippets
4. Be ready for submission or further review

## Testing Recommendation
Run `pdflatex paper-v5.tex` to verify successful compilation.
