# Constructive Framework Architecture

Following senior professor guidance, here's how the pieces fit together:

## Core Components

### 1. RegularReal.lean
- **Purpose**: Implement reals with fixed modulus |q_n - q_m| ≤ 2^{-n} + 2^{-m}
- **Why**: Dramatically simplifies arithmetic, especially multiplication
- **Status**: Basic structure done, multiplication proof needed

### 2. WitnessSimple.lean  
- **Purpose**: Unnormalized witness sequence v^α_n = ∑_{k=0}^n α_k
- **Why**: Simpler than normalized version, values are discrete (0 or ≥1)
- **Status**: Structure done, induction proofs needed

### 3. HahnBanachOneStep.lean
- **Purpose**: One-step extension from Y to Y + span(x)
- **Why**: Don't need full Zorn's lemma, just constructive extension
- **Key**: This is where ASP is needed to find extension value
- **Status**: Framework done, ASP application needed

### 4. ASP ↔ WLPO
- **Located**: Should be in WLPO_ASP_Core.lean
- **Purpose**: Show these are constructively equivalent
- **Why**: ASP is what makes Hahn-Banach work constructively

## The Main Flow

```
WLPO 
  ↓ (equivalence)
ASP
  ↓ (enables)
One-step Hahn-Banach
  ↓ (proves c₀ located)
Located distance for c₀
  ↓ (constructs gap)
Bidual Gap

Bidual Gap
  ↓ (witness sequence)
Sequence in c₀ or not
  ↓ (discrete values)
WLPO instance
```

## Key Insights from Senior Professor

1. **Cluster 1 (Limits, MCT, completeness)**: These ARE provable in BISH
   - Just technical challenges, not fundamental obstacles
   - Regular reals make this easier

2. **Cluster 2 (Hahn-Banach)**: This REQUIRES WLPO
   - Cannot be proven in pure BISH
   - This is the heart of the paper
   - One-step extension suffices

3. **No Additional Axioms**: 
   - Don't use DC or other axioms
   - WLPO is exactly what's needed

## Integration Plan

1. **Complete RegularReal arithmetic**
   - Finish multiplication proof
   - Add comparison operators

2. **Finish witness sequence proofs**
   - Complete induction for discreteness
   - Link to c₀ membership

3. **Connect ASP to one-step extension**
   - Show how ASP gives us the extension value
   - Prove bounds are preserved

4. **Prove c₀ is located**
   - Use MCT on tail suprema
   - Connect to distance function

5. **Assemble main theorem**
   - Forward: Gap → witness → WLPO
   - Reverse: WLPO → ASP → Hahn-Banach → Gap

## Technical Debt

From junior professor's list:
- Import paths ✓ (fixed)
- Multiplication modulus (in progress with regular reals)
- Located distance (framework ready)
- Witness convergence (simplified approach ready)

## Success Criteria

Per senior professor:
1. CReal + basic arithmetic (no sorry)
2. WLPO ↔ ASP proofs (no sorry)
3. Constructive Hahn-Banach for c₀ in ℓ∞ (≤5 sorries ok)
4. Gap ↔ WLPO main theorem (sorry-free)
5. Benchmark table comparing classical vs constructive
