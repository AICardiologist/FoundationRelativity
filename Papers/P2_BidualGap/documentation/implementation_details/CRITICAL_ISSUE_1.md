# Critical Issue: ASP → WLPO Proof

## The Problem

In proving ASP → WLPO, we construct a sequence:
- s(n) = 1 - 1/(n+1) if α(n) = true
- s(n) = 0 if α(n) = false

The supremum of {s(n) : n ∈ ℕ} should tell us about α:
- If sup = 0, then all α(n) = false
- If sup > 0, then some α(n) = true

**BUT**: We cannot constructively decide "sup = 0 or sup > 0" because CReal doesn't have decidable ordering!

## Why This Matters

This is exactly what makes constructive mathematics subtle. In classical math, we'd use LEM to decide sup = 0 ∨ sup > 0. But that's not available in BISH.

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Use Approximation Property Differently
Instead of trying to decide sup = 0 vs sup > 0, use the approximation property more cleverly. The ASP gives us elements arbitrarily close to sup.

### 2. Different Encoding
Maybe encode α differently so the decision comes from the approximation property more directly.

### 3. Check Literature
Ishihara must have handled this. We need to check the exact construction in the original papers.

## Question for Professor

"In the ASP → WLPO direction, we construct a bounded sequence encoding α, get its supremum via ASP, but then cannot decide if sup = 0 or sup > 0 (no decidable ordering on CReal). How does Ishihara's proof extract the WLPO decision from the supremum's approximation property without using decidable ordering?"

## Current Status

Proof is blocked at line 91 of WLPO_ASP.lean. Cannot proceed without resolving this fundamental issue.
