# ⚠️ Paper 2 Formalization Status

**CRITICAL**: This paper is NOT actually formalized despite "0 sorries" claim.

## Current State

The files in this directory contain only placeholder stubs:
- `BidualGap` is defined as `structure BidualGap where dummy : Unit`
- `WLPO` is defined as `structure WLPO where dummy : Unit`
- The "main theorem" is proved by pattern matching on Unit constructors

## What's Missing

The actual mathematical content from the LaTeX paper is not formalized:
- Bidual space X** definition
- Canonical embedding ι : X → X**
- Goldstine's theorem
- Weak* topology
- Quantitative gap estimates
- Real WLPO equivalence proof

## Required Work

See [/CRITICAL_QA_NOTICE.md](/CRITICAL_QA_NOTICE.md) for the full work plan.

Estimated effort: 4-6 weeks with functional analysis consultant.
