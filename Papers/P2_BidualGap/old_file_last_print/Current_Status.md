# Option 2 Current Status

## Verdict: Still NOT complete

### Progress Made
✅ Fixed imports (using available mathlib APIs)
✅ Found correct lemmas: `Submodule.mkQ_apply`, `Submodule.Quotient.norm_mk_le`, `Submodule.Quotient.mk_eq_zero`
✅ Implemented HB extension approach (avoiding SeparatingDual)
✅ Structure of proofs follows your surgical guidance

### Remaining Issues
❌ **QuotSeparation.lean does NOT compile** - 10 errors remain
❌ **6 sorrys** in the file:
  1. `constOne_not_mem_Scl` 
  2. `f₀` construction on 1D subspace
  3. `f₀_y` property
  4. `g_on_quot_y` proof completion
  5-6. Technical steps in proofs

### Specific Blockers
1. Line 36: Type mismatch in `q` construction - `convert` tactic issues
2. Line 48: Failed to synthesize `NormedAddCommGroup` instance
3. Line 76+: Type class inference stuck (metavariables)
4. HB extension construction incomplete

### What Compiles
- SimpleFacts.lean (with 2 sorrys)
- Basic imports and type definitions

### What Doesn't Compile
- QuotSeparation.lean (main file)
- test_quotsep.lean (smoke test - depends on broken QuotSeparation)
- WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean (not implemented)

## Summary
Despite following the surgical fixes, the implementation still has compilation failures due to:
- API mismatches in this mathlib version
- Type inference issues with quotient spaces
- Incomplete 1D functional construction

The mathematical approach is correct but the technical Lean 4 details remain unresolved.
