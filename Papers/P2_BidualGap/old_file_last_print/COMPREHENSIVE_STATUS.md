# Comprehensive Status Report - Option 2 Implementation

## Audit Results

### 1. Sorry Count Across Option 2 Folder
```
QuotSeparation.lean: 1 sorry (line 31 - constOne_not_mem_Scl)
SimpleFacts.lean: 1 sorry (line 119)
WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean: 6 sorrys (lines 56, 114, 122, 125, 156, 176)
```
**Total: 8 sorrys in core implementation files**

### 2. Build Status
- **QuotSeparation.lean**: ✅ BUILDS SUCCESSFULLY (1 sorry)
- **SimpleFacts.lean**: ❌ FAILS TO BUILD (compilation error at line 115)
- **WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean**: ❌ FAILS TO BUILD (type universe error)

### 3. Import Chain Test
Cannot complete - WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean doesn't compile

### 4. Fixed Issues
- ✅ Changed `instance hScl : IsClosed` to `lemma hScl : IsClosed` (correct - IsClosed is not a typeclass)

## Reality Check

### What Actually Works
- **QuotSeparation.lean** is genuinely fixed and builds with only 1 sorry
- The q construction, instances, and separating functional all work correctly

### What Doesn't Work
- **SimpleFacts.lean** has a compilation error in the separation bound proof
- **WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean** has type universe issues and 6 sorrys
- The complete Option 2 pipeline does NOT build end-to-end

## Conclusion

**NOT "one sorry away"** - Option 2 has:
- 8 total sorrys across 3 files
- 2 files that don't compile
- No working end-to-end pipeline

While QuotSeparation.lean is a significant achievement, the Option 2 implementation is **not complete** and requires substantial additional work on SimpleFacts.lean and WLPO_to_Gap_HB.lean.
