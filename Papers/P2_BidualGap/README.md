## Overview

Paper 2 calibrates the **existence of a bidual gap** (J_X: X â†’ X** non-surjective for some real Banach space X)
exactly at the strength of the **Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience (WLPO)** over Bishop-style
constructive mathematics (BISH).

## Current Status (September 2025)

**Total sorries: 3** (all WLPO-conditional in optional completeness module)
- Main equivalence theorem: âœ… Complete (0 sorries)
- Witness construction with câ‚€: âœ… Complete (0 sorries)  
- Optional completeness lemmas: 3 WLPO-conditional sorries

### Recent Update (September 2025)
Following discussions in the Lean Zulip group, we have updated the proof construction
to be more consistent with Constructive Reverse Mathematics (CRM) requirements.
The changes focus on proper fencing of classical reasoning and a more robust
approach to the gap parameter Î´. We believe the current approach is correct,
but it would benefit from verification by experts in constructive reverse mathematics.

## Key Results

### Main Equivalence Theorem
```lean
theorem gap_equiv_wlpo : BidualGapStrong.{0} â†” WLPO
```

The theorem establishes that the existence of any Banach space with a bidual gap
is exactly equivalent to WLPO over constructive mathematics.

### Witness Space
The formalization uses **câ‚€** (sequences vanishing at infinity) as the witness space,
with the bidual functional G : (câ‚€)** defined by G(f) = Î£â‚™ f(eâ‚™) where (eâ‚™) is the standard basis.

### Technical Innovations
- **Ishihara Kernel**: Prop-level construction avoiding computational overhead
- **Option-B Bridge**: Abstract pattern for gap construction
- **Robust csSup**: Direct suprema approach avoiding fragile instance resolution
- **CRM-Compliant Construction**: Proper fencing of classical reasoning with constructive consumer
- **Concrete Î´-Gap**: Uses `Î´ := |y(hâ‹†)|/2` avoiding bidual norm type inference issues

## Mathematical Overview

### The Bidual Gap Problem
For a Banach space X, the canonical embedding J: X â†’ X** maps each x âˆˆ X to the
evaluation functional J(x)(f) = f(x). Whether J is surjective depends on the
foundational setting:
- **Classical (ZFC)**: Hahn-Banach implies gaps exist for â„“âˆž, câ‚€
- **Constructive (BISH)**: Gap existence unprovable without additional axioms

### WLPO (Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience)
For any binary sequence Î±: â„• â†’ {0,1}:
```
(âˆ€n, Î±(n) = 0) âˆ¨ Â¬(âˆ€n, Î±(n) = 0)
```

WLPO is strictly weaker than LEM but not provable in BISH. It captures the
minimal decision strength needed to determine whether a sequence is identically zero.

### Forward Direction: Gap â†’ WLPO
Given a gap witness y âˆˆ X** \ J(X), we construct an Ishihara kernel that
decides WLPO instances through a dichotomy property on evaluation values.

### Reverse Direction: WLPO â†’ Gap
Using WLPO's decision power, we:
1. Separate câ‚€ from its complement in bounded sequences
2. Construct G(f) = Î£f(eâ‚™) on (câ‚€)*
3. Prove G âˆ‰ J(câ‚€) using WLPO's discrimination
