TITLE:
QCD One-Loop Renormalization and Confinement: Asymptotic Freedom, the Mass Gap, and Why Confinement Is Free over BISH + LPO (Paper 33, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

DESCRIPTION:
Paper 33 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics of Mathematical Physics series. This paper provides a complete constructive reverse-mathematical calibration of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at one-loop order, extended into the non-perturbative sector including confinement and the Yang-Mills mass gap. Asymptotic freedom and the Lambda_QCD divergence are BISH-computable (mirroring Paper 32's QED analysis with the sign of the beta function flipped). The key finding is that confinement is logically free: the LPO already paid for the continuum limit automatically subsidizes both the WLPO needed for mass gap decisions and Markov's Principle needed for strict positivity extraction. Discrete RG steps, Lambda_QCD divergence, and finite-lattice mass gaps are all BISH. Threshold crossings cost WLPO, the continuum limit costs LPO, and mass gap plus confinement are subsumed. All results formalized in Lean 4 over Mathlib with zero sorry. The formalization comprises 6 Lean source files.
