  "title": "Class Number Correction for Exotic Weil Classes on CM Abelian Fourfolds (Paper 58, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)",
  "description": "<p>Paper 58 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics and Arithmetic Geometry series. Papers 56&ndash;57 established the formula h = f for the Hermitian self-intersection of exotic Weil classes on CM abelian fourfolds, where f is the conductor and h_K = 1. This paper extends to quadratic imaginary fields with class number h_K &gt; 1.</p>\n<p>The corrected formula is h &middot; Nm(a) = f, where a is the Steinitz class of the integral Weil lattice, uniquely determined by a decidable norm condition. The topological volume det(G) = f&sup2; |&Delta;_K| is an absolute geometric invariant; the class group redistributes it between the Hermitian metric h and the lattice density Nm(a).</p>\n<p>Test field: K = Q(&radic;(&minus;5)), h_K = 2, |&Delta;_K| = 20. Verified for all nine conductors from Papers 56&ndash;57: 4 split (f = 7, 9, 61, 163), 5 inert. Steinitz class forced by mod-5 infinite descent. All Gram matrix determinants verified by native_decide.</p>\n<p>CRM classification: BISH. The Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization comprises 6 source files (~805 lines), zero errors, zero warnings, zero sorry, zero custom axioms. The corrected formula is a proof obligation (structure field) verified per-instance by native_decide.</p>\n<p>Code is distributed exclusively via this Zenodo record.</p>",
