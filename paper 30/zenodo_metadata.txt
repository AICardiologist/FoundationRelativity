TITLE:
The Physical Dispensability of the Fan Theorem: A Lean 4 Formalization (Paper 30, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

DESCRIPTION:
Paper 30 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics of Mathematical Physics series. This paper proves that the Fan Theorem (FT) is physically dispensable: every empirically accessible prediction derived from FT-calibrated results is recoverable in BISH + LPO without invoking FT. The argument proceeds in three pillars. First, approximate optimization to any finite precision requires only bounded monotone convergence (equivalent to LPO), not the full Fan Theorem. Second, a separation theorem establishes that the exact Extreme Value Theorem is equivalent to the Fan Theorem, pinpointing where the logical cost genuinely lies. Third, variational mechanics decomposes into a three-way stratification: the Euler-Lagrange equation is BISH, approximate action minimization is LPO, and only the existence of an exact action minimizer requires FT --- but no finite experiment can distinguish the latter from the LPO approximation. All results are formalized in Lean 4 over Mathlib with zero sorry, zero custom axioms in the core separation theorem, and complete axiom audits. The formalization comprises 7 Lean source files.
