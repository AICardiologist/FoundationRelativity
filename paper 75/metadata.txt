Description: We apply the DPT framework (Papers 72-74) as an external diagnostic on the Genestier-Lafforgue semisimple local Langlands parametrization for arbitrary reductive G. The Fargues-Scholze proof decomposes into three independently calibrated layers: algebraic (solidification, BISH), homological (K-injective resolutions, CLASS via Zorn), and geometric (v-topology, CLASS via BPI). The statement costs only BISH + WLPO: Schur's lemma applied to the Bernstein center deterministically extracts the semisimple parameter, and the residual cost is the trace equality test (WLPO, Paper 74). We prove a strict conservation gap (WLPO < CLASS), verify that DPT correctly predicts the statement cost, and identify exactly where classical logic enters the proof. Whether the CLASS scaffolding is eliminable remains an open conjecture. Lean 4 formalization: ~180 lines, zero sorry, zero propext, zero Classical.choice.
