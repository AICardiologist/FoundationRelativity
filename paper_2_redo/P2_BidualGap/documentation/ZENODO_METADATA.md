## Description
Lean 4 formalization proving the equivalence between the Weak Limited Principle of Omniscience (WLPO) and the existence of Banach spaces with bidual gaps. This release contains the minimal reproducible build with the Option-B core theorem fully proven.

### Key Results
- **Option-B Core Theorem**: HasNonzeroQuotFunctional + QuotToGapBridge ⇒ GapX (fully proven)
- **Witness Space**: c₀ (sequences vanishing at infinity)  
- **Dual Isometry**: (c₀ →L[ℝ] ℝ) ≃ₗᵢ ℓ¹ implementation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated verification with 0 errors

### Contents
- Complete Paper 2 formalization under `Papers/P2_BidualGap/`
- Option-B framework with typeclass-based architecture
- Minimal build target compiling with all proofs complete
- Supporting build infrastructure and CI workflows
