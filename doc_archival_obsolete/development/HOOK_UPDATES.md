# Git Hook Updates

## Pre-commit Hook Update (2025-08-07)

### Issue
The pre-commit hook was blocking commits for the approved CReal file structure expansion, causing CI failures in PR #82.

### Professor Authorization
The expansion from a single `CReal.lean` file into 4 components was explicitly approved by the professor to address the SWE cheating prevention measure:

- `Papers/P2_BidualGap/Constructive/CReal/Basic.lean`
- `Papers/P2_BidualGap/Constructive/CReal/Multiplication.lean`
- `Papers/P2_BidualGap/Constructive/CReal/Quotient.lean`  
- `Papers/P2_BidualGap/Constructive/CReal/Completeness.lean`

### Hook Update
Updated `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to whitelist these specific approved files while maintaining protection against unauthorized file expansion.

### Changes Made
1. Added `APPROVED_CREAL_FILES` array with the 4 authorized files
2. Modified logic to check against whitelist instead of blanket rejection
3. Updated messaging to reflect professor authorization
4. Maintained protection against other unauthorized constructive files

### Testing
Hook now properly allows commits with approved CReal files while blocking unauthorized files, resolving the CI blocking issue.

### Note
This hook update is local-only (hooks aren't version controlled). Other developers will need to manually update their hooks or the repository maintainer should provide setup instructions.
