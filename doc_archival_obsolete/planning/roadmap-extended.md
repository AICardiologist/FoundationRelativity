# Foundation-Relativity Strategic Roadmap (Post-Audit Update)

## 🎯 Current Status: Paper 1 Complete ✅ | Papers 2-3 Need Implementation

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-03  
**Current Version**: v0.9.1  
**Status**: Paper 1 Complete (0 sorries), Papers 2-3 need implementation, Paper 4 in progress  
**Latest Achievement**: Paper 1 (Gödel-Banach) 100% formalized with 0 sorries (PR #78)  
**QA Update**: Papers 2-3 Unit/() tricks replaced with honest sorries (PR #77)

> **Note**: A QA audit revealed that Papers 2-3 contained only placeholder implementations. These have been converted to honest sorries pending real implementation.
