TITLE:
The Undecidability Landscape Is LPO: Phase Diagrams, Spectral Gaps, and RG Flows (Paper 37, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

DESCRIPTION:
Paper 37 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics of Mathematical Physics series. This paper proves a meta-theorem: every known undecidability result in quantum many-body physics is exactly LPO (the Limited Principle of Omniscience). Phase diagrams (Bausch-Cubitt-Watson 2021), one-dimensional spectral gaps (Bausch-Cubitt-Lucia-Perez-Garcia 2020), and renormalization group flows (Cubitt-Lucia-Perez-Garcia-Eisert 2022) are all shown to be Turing-Weihrauch equivalent to LPO. The meta-theorem works because all these results share the same architecture: encode a Turing machine into a Hamiltonian, reduce halting to a physical property, and observe that the resulting decision is exactly LPO. The one exception --- ground state energy density (Watson-Cubitt 2021) --- is BISH-computable because it admits explicit finite-precision computation without any oracle. The "undecidability" of physics is a misnomer: it is the non-computability of a single, well-understood logical principle that physics has used since Boltzmann. All results formalized in Lean 4 over Mathlib with zero sorry. The formalization comprises 7 Lean source files.
