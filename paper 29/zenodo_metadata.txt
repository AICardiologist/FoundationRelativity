AUTHORS

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Paper 29 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics (CRM) of Physics series.

This deposit contains the complete Lean 4 + Mathlib formalization proving
that Fekete's Subadditive Lemma -- the assertion that every subadditive
sequence with u(n)/n bounded below converges -- is equivalent to the
Limited Principle of Omniscience (LPO) over Bishop-style constructive
mathematics (BISH). Includes the accompanying paper (LaTeX source and
compiled PDF).


MAIN RESULTS

Backward direction (fully proved, zero sorry):

  * lpo_of_fekete: Given any binary sequence alpha, encode it into a mock
    free energy F_n = -n * x_n where x_n = 1 iff exists k < n, alpha(k) =
    true. F is subadditive with F_n/n >= -1. Applying Fekete's lemma and
    evaluating at a sufficiently large truncation decides LPO.

Forward direction (axiomatized from literature):

  * fekete_of_lpo: Composes LPO -> BMC (Bridges-Vita 2006, Theorem 2.1.5)
    with the classical Fekete proof via bounded monotone convergence
    (available in Mathlib as Subadditive.tendsto_lim).

Main equivalence:

  * fekete_iff_lpo: FeketeConvergence <-> LPO (over BISH).


THREE-TIER HIERARCHY FOR THERMODYNAMIC-LIMIT CONVERGENCE

  Cluster expansion (exponential decay)  BISH           High-temp lattice gases
  Generic subadditivity (Fekete)         LPO            This paper

The LPO cost becomes ineliminable when explicit finite-size bounds are
unavailable -- typically near phase transitions where correlation lengths
diverge. This resolves Problem 1 from Paper 10.


AXIOM CERTIFICATE

  * Backward direction: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] -- standard
    Mathlib infrastructure only. No LPO, WLPO, LLPO, or custom axioms.

  * Full equivalence: Above plus bmc_of_lpo and fekete_of_bmc (axiomatized,
    citing Bridges-Vita 2006 and Mathlib's Subadditive.tendsto_lim).

  * Zero sorry. Zero custom axioms in backward direction.
