## TITLE

"Three Axioms for the Motive: A Decidability Characterization
of Grothendieck's Universal Cohomology"

## THE CENTRAL CLAIM

The motive — Grothendieck's conjectural universal cohomology
theory — is characterized by three axioms from constructive logic:

1. DecidableEq on morphism spaces (decidable morphisms)
2. IsIntegral ℤ on endomorphisms (integral/algebraic spectrum)
3. InnerProductSpace ℝ on Archimedean realizations (positive-
   definite polarization)

These three axioms define a category (DecidablePolarizedTannakian)
whose initial object recovers the known theory of motives. The
Weil Riemann Hypothesis follows from the axioms alone. The
category is explicitly inhabited over finite fields via the
Honda-Tate construction. Standard Conjecture D is precisely the
axiom asserting that this category has decidable morphisms.

## AUDIENCE

Primary: arithmetic geometers, Langlands programme researchers.
Secondary: formalization community (Lean/Mathlib), constructive
mathematicians, mathematical logicians.

The paper must be legible to someone who knows algebraic geometry
and category theory but has never encountered constructive
reverse mathematics. CRM terminology must be introduced cleanly
and motivated by the mathematics, not assumed.

## TONE

Technical, precise, understated. No overclaiming. No rhetoric.
Let the mathematics speak. Where the framework classifies but
does not solve, say so explicitly. Where results are new, state
them as theorems. Where results are reformulations, say
"reformulation" not "discovery."

Substance over style. No bullet points in the body. Prose
paragraphs throughout. Mathematical notation standard (LaTeX).
Lean 4 code blocks where formal verification is referenced.

## STRUCTURE

The paper leads with the characterization (the surprise),
supports it with verification (Lean code), then provides
context (calibrations, dual hierarchy, roadmaps).

### Section 1: Introduction (1.5 pages)

Open with the observation: the motive has been characterized
geometrically (Grothendieck's universal Weil cohomology),
homologically (Nori's diagram category), homotopically
(Voevodsky's triangulated motives), and via motivated cycles
(André). Each characterization uses the language of algebraic
geometry or homological algebra.

We propose a characterization from a different direction:
constructive logic. By calibrating five major conjectures
(Weight-Monodromy, Tate, Fontaine-Mazur, BSD, Hodge) against
the constructive hierarchy (BISH ⊂ MP ⊂ LPO), a uniform
pattern emerges. Each conjecture asserts that continuous
cohomological data over a complete field (requiring the Limited
Principle of Omniscience, LPO, for zero-testing) descends to
discrete algebraic data over ℚ (decidable in Bishop's
constructive mathematics, BISH, or BISH with Markov's
Principle, MP).

This "de-omniscientizing descent" is captured by three axioms.
We define the category of Decidable Polarized Tannakian
categories and propose that the motive is the initial object
in this category.

State the main results:
- Theorem A: The Weil RH follows from the three axioms.
- Theorem B: The category is inhabited over 𝔽_p (Honda-Tate).
- Theorem C: Standard Conjecture D is equivalent to Axiom 1.
- Theorem D (Dual Hierarchy): The major conjectures live at
  Π₂⁰ in the arithmetic hierarchy; the motive acts as a -1
  shift operator.
- Theorem E (CM Rescue): The subcategory generated by CM
  elliptic curves over ℚ is unconditionally BISH-decidable.
  All three ℚ-obstructions (LPO, FM, MP) are lifted.
- All results formally verified in Lean 4 [where applicable].

Brief paragraph on what the paper does NOT claim: it does not
prove any of the major conjectures. It characterizes their
logical structure and defines the category that would contain
their solutions.

### Section 2: Constructive Preliminaries (1.5 pages)

Introduce CRM for the algebraic geometry audience. Keep it
minimal — only what's needed to understand the paper.

Define BISH (Bishop's constructive mathematics — no excluded
middle, no choice beyond dependent choice). Define LPO (for
any binary sequence, either some term is 1 or all terms are 0
— equivalent to: equality is decidable on ℝ). Define MP
(if a computation does not diverge, it converges — equivalent
to: ¬¬∃ implies ∃ for decidable predicates).

The hierarchy: BISH ⊂ MP ⊂ LPO ⊂ CLASS. Each inclusion strict.

The key observation for arithmetic geometry: zero-testing over
a complete field (ℝ, ℂ, ℚ_ℓ, ℚ_p) requires LPO. Zero-testing
over ℚ or ℚ̄ (presented as minimal polynomial + root isolation
data) is decidable in BISH. The transition from complete-field
data to algebraic data eliminates LPO.

Define the u-invariant: u(k) = maximum dimension of an
anisotropic quadratic form over k. State: u(ℝ) = 1 (positive-
definite forms exist in all dimensions), u(ℚ_p) = 4 (no
positive-definite form in dimension ≥ 5). This bifurcation
controls which completions admit polarization.

### Section 3: The Three Axioms (2 pages)

This is the core section. Define the DecidablePolarized
Tannakian category.

Let C be a ℚ-linear, rigid, symmetric monoidal category with
fiber functor ω : C → Vec_ℚ (i.e., a neutral Tannakian
category over ℚ). Let H_ℓ : C → Vec_{ℚ_ℓ} be a family of
ℓ-adic realization functors and H_ℝ : C → Vec_ℝ an
Archimedean realization functor.

Axiom 1 (Decidable Morphisms): For all objects X, Y in C,
the ℚ-vector space Hom_C(X, Y) has decidable equality.
Formally: DecidableEq (X ⟶ Y).

Axiom 2 (Algebraic Spectrum): For all objects X in C and all
endomorphisms f : X → X, f is integral over ℤ. Formally:
IsIntegral ℤ f. Equivalently: the eigenvalues of f (in any
realization) are algebraic integers, and the characteristic
polynomial is independent of the realization.

Axiom 3 (Archimedean Polarization): For all objects X in C,
the real vector space H_ℝ(X) carries a positive-definite
inner product compatible with the involution on End(X).
Formally: InnerProductSpace ℝ (H_ℝ.obj X).

Discuss each axiom's origin from the calibrations (briefly):
- Axiom 1 ← Standard Conjecture D (Section 5 gives details)
- Axiom 2 ← geometric origin (Frobenius eigenvalues are Weil
  numbers, algebraic integers)
- Axiom 3 ← the Archimedean polarization succeeds because
  u(ℝ) = 1; it fails over ℚ_p because u(ℚ_p) = 4

Present the Lean 4 type signature:

```lean

    (C : Type u) [Category.{v} C]
    [MonoidalCategory C] [SymmetricCategory C]

  algebraic_spectrum : ∀ {X : C} (f : X ⟶ X), IsIntegral ℤ f
  polarization : ∀ (X : C),
    InnerProductSpace ℝ (real_fiber.obj X)
```

### Section 4: The Weil RH from Three Axioms (2 pages)

Theorem A. State and prove the Weil Riemann Hypothesis as a
consequence of the three axioms.

The proof has four steps:
1. By Axiom 2, the Frobenius endomorphism π has algebraic
   integer eigenvalues. Its characteristic polynomial
   P(t) ∈ ℤ[t] is independent of ℓ.
2. By Axiom 3, the Archimedean realization carries a positive-
   definite form ⟨·,·⟩. By the Rosati condition
   (π† = q^w/π), we compute ⟨πx, πx⟩ = q^w ⟨x, x⟩.
3. By positive-definiteness, ⟨x, x⟩ > 0 for x ≠ 0. This is
   the constructive bottleneck: division by ⟨x, x⟩ requires
   knowing it is nonzero, which positive-definiteness provides.
4. Therefore |π|² = q^w, giving |π| = q^{w/2}.

Present the Lean 4 proof (compiled, zero sorries).

Discuss what the proof reveals: the Weil RH is not fundamentally
about algebraic geometry. It is about the interaction between
decidability (Axiom 1, used implicitly for morphism manipulation),
integrality (Axiom 2, ensuring algebraic eigenvalues), and
positive-definiteness (Axiom 3, enabling the division). The
geometric content is in the Rosati condition, which is the one
geometric axiom beyond the three logical axioms.

### Section 5: Standard Conjecture D as Decidability (1.5 pages)

Theorem C. Standard Conjecture D (homological equivalence equals
numerical equivalence) is equivalent to Axiom 1.

One direction: if D holds, then the ℚ_ℓ-linear homological
equivalence (which requires LPO for zero-testing) coincides
with numerical equivalence (integer intersection numbers,
BISH-decidable). Therefore Hom_num has decidable equality.

Other direction: if Hom has decidable equality (Axiom 1), then
we can decide in finite time whether a homologically trivial
cycle is numerically trivial.

This reinterprets D: it is not primarily a statement about
algebraic cycles and cohomology theories. It is the assertion
that the motivic category has decidable morphism spaces — the
foundational requirement for the category to be constructively
well-defined.

### Section 6: Explicit Inhabitant over 𝔽_p (2.5 pages)

Theorem B. Construct the explicit inhabitant for an ordinary
elliptic curve over 𝔽_p.

Present the Weil1 structure (trace a, Hasse bound a² < 4p).
The rational skeleton ℚ² with basis {1, π}. The Frobenius
matrix [[0, -p], [1, a]]. The Rosati form [[2, a], [a, 2p]]
with determinant 4p - a² > 0.

Verify each axiom explicitly:
- Axiom 1: DecidableEq on ℚ² is inferInstance. Free.
- Axiom 2: Frobenius satisfies X² - aX + p = 0 ∈ ℤ[t]. By
  Cayley-Hamilton.
- Axiom 3: Rosati matrix has det > 0 by Hasse bound.
  Positive-definite by Sylvester's criterion.

The Hasse bound IS Axiom 3. The most classical result in
arithmetic geometry (Hasse 1933) is literally the positive-
definiteness condition for this specific motive.

Present the Lean 4 code (compiled, zero custom axioms).

The full category Mot_num(𝔽_q): objects are formal direct sums
of simple motives h(π), morphisms are matrices over division
algebras, tensor product from Künneth. The entire category is
BISH-decidable.

### Section 7: The Obstruction over ℚ (1.5 pages)

Three precise failures when attempting the same construction
over number fields:

1. Galois generator deficit: Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ) is not cyclic. The
   motive requires infinitely many Frobenius traces (the
   L-function), which requires LPO to evaluate.
2. Honda-Tate surjectivity failure: over ℚ, we don't know
   which abstract data corresponds to geometry (Fontaine-Mazur).
3. Tate cycle computability failure: morphisms require
   Diophantine search (MP) by Matiyasevich.

The motive over ℚ is a category whose objects and morphisms
we can specify but not enumerate. The specification is the
universal property. The enumeration requires proving the
Standard Conjectures.

The intermediate case: the full CM conjecture (all CM abelian
varieties) FAILS for dimension ≥ 4 due to exotic Weil classes
whose algebraicity is open (Deligne proved they are absolute
Hodge, not that they are algebraic). This failure validates
the framework: the CRM diagnostic correctly predicts that
unknown Hodge witnesses cost MP.

### Section 8: The CM Rescue — Decidability for CM Elliptic
Motives (3 pages)

THIS IS THE POSITIVE THEOREM OVER ℚ. The paper's strongest
original result.

**Theorem E.** The Tannakian subcategory of Mot_num(ℚ)
generated by motives of CM elliptic curves is unconditionally
BISH-decidable. Specifically, all three CRM axioms are
satisfied and all three ℚ-obstructions are lifted:

**Obstruction 1 lifted (LPO → BISH via Damerell).**
For a CM elliptic curve E/ℚ with CM by K, the L-function
L(E,s) = L(ψ,s) for a Hecke character ψ. By Damerell's
theorem, L(E,1)/Ω is an exact rational number computable
by finite algorithms (modular symbols, elliptic units).
Testing L(E,1) = 0 is strict finite arithmetic. The LPO
limit that makes BSD hard for generic curves does not exist
for CM curves.

**Obstruction 2 lifted (Fontaine-Mazur → table lookup).**
CM elliptic curves over ℚ correspond to the 13 imaginary
quadratic fields of class number 1 (Heegner numbers
d = -3, -4, -7, -8, -11, -19, -43, -67, -163). Constructing
the variety from the CM type is a finite table lookup. Δ₀.

**Obstruction 3 lifted (MP → linear algebra via Lefschetz).**
For products of CM elliptic curves E₁ × ··· × Eₙ, all Hodge
classes are generated by divisor classes (Lefschetz (1,1)
theorem). Divisor classes correspond to Hermitian matrices
over K. The unbounded Diophantine search (MP) collapses to
finite linear algebra over ℚ.

**The explicit algorithms** (present each):

(a) Hom computation: Check if K₁ = K₂ (13 j-invariants).
    If different, Hom = 0. If same, Hom = matrices over K.
    Status: BISH.

(b) Zero-testing: Is a rational matrix the zero matrix?
    Status: BISH (trivially).

(c) Motivic decomposition: h(E) = 1 ⊕ h¹(E) ⊕ L. For
    tensor powers, orthogonal idempotents via minimal
    polynomial factoring (LLL algorithm). Status: BISH.

(d) Hodge class computation: Output the standard basis for
    Hermitian matrices over K. Status: BISH.

**Why this works for elliptic curves but not dimension ≥ 4:**
In dimension ≥ 4, exotic Weil classes exist that do not lie
in the algebra generated by divisors. Their algebraicity is
open (the general Hodge conjecture for CM abelian varieties).
The framework correctly predicts: no witness → MP obstruction
remains. The restriction to elliptic curves is not ad hoc —
it is the exact boundary where Lefschetz (1,1) provides the
witnesses that bypass MP.

**The philosophical interpretation:** Increasing algebraic
symmetry (from generic Galois to abelian CM) strictly lowers
logical complexity. CM is the exact mathematical mechanism
that collapses LPO and MP into BISH. The three-axiom
characterization explains WHY CM is tractable — not just that
it is.

Note: Lieberman's theorem (D for abelian varieties) is not
needed as an axiom here. For surfaces, Matsusaka's classical
theorem gives homological = numerical equivalence. The CM
elliptic curve result is UNCONDITIONAL — no conjectures
assumed.

**The Langlands progression.** The CM decidability theorem
reframes the historical development of the Langlands programme
as an ascent through the arithmetic hierarchy:

- 1920s–1960s: CM cases (Hecke, Deuring, Shimura-Taniyama).
  Logical complexity: BISH. Proofs use explicit computation,
  class field theory, finite sums. No non-constructive
  principles required. This is why they were proved first —
  not because they were "easier" in a vague sense, but
  because every computation terminates, every search is
  bounded, every zero-test is finite arithmetic.

- 1995–2001: Semistable/all elliptic curves over ℚ (Wiles,
  Taylor-Wiles, BCDT). Logical complexity: BISH + MP.
  Modularity lifting requires searching over Galois
  deformation spaces — bounded but nontrivial searches.
  Taylor-Wiles patching is, from the CRM perspective, a
  technique for forcing MP-type searches to terminate by
  constructing algebraic structures that bound them.

- 2010s–present: Potential automorphy, Calegari-Geraghty,
  10-author theorem. Logical complexity: approaching LPO.
  Working over totally real fields, controlling Archimedean
  places one at a time. p-adic Hodge theory and perfectoid
  spaces are machinery for managing LPO-level zero-testing
  through algebraic surrogates.

Each generation of the programme climbs one step up the
logical hierarchy and requires correspondingly heavier
machinery to compensate. The CRM framework makes this
progression precise: CM is BISH, classical modularity
is BISH + MP, contemporary automorphy is BISH + MP +
fragments of LPO.

This is stated as an observation supported by the logical
analysis, not as a theorem. Formalizing the precise logical
cost of Taylor-Wiles patching or perfectoid methods is
beyond the scope of this paper but is identified as a
natural target for future calibration.

Present the Lean 4 code (compiled, zero sorries where
possible). The formalization strategy: axiomatize the
geometric functors (CM motive, Betti realization) as bridge
lemmas; PROVE the algebraic decidability (matrix computation,
zero-testing, decomposition) in pure Mathlib.

### Section 9: The Dual Hierarchy (2.5 pages)

Theorem D. This is the second major finding of the paper.

The calibrations in Sections 3–6 measure instance complexity:
the difficulty of verifying a conjecture for a single variety.
This lives at Π₁⁰ (LPO). But the conjectures themselves are
universal statements — "for all varieties..." — and
universally quantifying over Π₁⁰ predicates gives Π₂⁰.

Establish the arithmetic complexity:
- Standard Conjecture D: Π₂⁰
- Hodge Conjecture: Π₂⁰
- Fontaine-Mazur: Π₂⁰ (or Π₁¹)
- Finiteness of Ш: Σ₂⁰

The Hodge Conjecture has the identical logical signature to
the spectral gap problem (Cubitt-Perez-Garcia-Wolf, 2015).
The finiteness of Ш is the arithmetic spectral gap.

The L-function does NOT reach Π₂⁰, because the Weil bounds
control convergence. This is a structural triumph of the
Archimedean polarization.

The motive as -1 shift operator: it accepts a Π₂⁰ axiom
(Conjecture D) and delivers Σ₂⁰ → Σ₁⁰ descent on every
instance. It does not kill the Π₂⁰ level — it shifts
operational complexity down by one level.

The dual hierarchy:
- Metamathematical tier (Π₂⁰): where conjectures live
- Operational tier (Π₁⁰ → Σ₁⁰ → Δ₀): where computation
  happens, shifted down by the motive

### Section 10: Concrete Results and Roadmaps (2 pages)

Six specific theorems the framework produces. For each:
precise statement, novelty (new / newly constructive /
newly formal), estimated formalization difficulty.

1. Syntactic Weil Bound (formal verification first, days)
2. Constructive Semisimplicity of Frobenius (1–2 weeks)
3. Undecidability of Analytic Rank (1–2 weeks)
4. Motivic Isomorphism Decidability over 𝔽_q (2–4 weeks)
5. p-adic u=4 Impossibility Theorem (3–4 weeks)
6. CM Trivialization of Markov's Principle (1–2 months)

Roadmaps for major conjectures with honest probabilities:
- Conjecture D: <5% new, 90% formalization
- Hodge: 0% via CRM
- BSD rank 0/1: 85% Lean verification via height bounds
- Classical RH: 0%
- Langlands: 10% proofs, 60% formal statement

What the framework does NOT do (explicit disclaimer).

### Section 11: Comparison with Existing Characterizations (1.5 pages)

Brief comparison with:
- Grothendieck's universal Weil cohomology
- Nori's diagram category
- Voevodsky's DM(k)
- André's motivated cycles
- Deligne-Milne Tannakian formalism

For each: how does the three-axiom characterization relate?
Where does it agree? Where does it say something different?

Also compare with the Langlands programme's implicit use of
logical complexity: the historical progression from CM (BISH)
through classical modularity (BISH + MP) to contemporary
automorphy (approaching LPO) tracks the same hierarchy that
the three-axiom characterization makes explicit. The CRM
framework provides a logical explanation for why the
programme developed in the order it did.

### Section 12: Conclusion (0.5 pages)

The motive is the minimal decidability structure underlying
arithmetic geometry. Its three axioms are logical, not
geometric. Its universal property is decidability. The major
conjectures assert that this decidability structure is
universal (Π₂⁰). The motive shifts every instance one level
down in the arithmetic hierarchy.

No grandiose claims. No speculation about Langlands beyond
what's stated in the roadmaps. End with the CM decidability
conjecture as the natural next target.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. LEAD WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION. The first thing the reader
   encounters after the introduction is the three axioms and
   the Lean type signature. Not the calibrations. Not the
   philosophy. The axioms.

2. DO NOT OVERCLAIM. The paper characterizes, classifies, and
   formalizes. It does not prove the major conjectures. Say
   this explicitly in §1 and §9.

3. THE LEAN CODE IS NOT DECORATION. It is evidence. Every
   theorem that has compiled Lean code should present it
   inline, not in an appendix. The compilation status (zero
   sorries, zero custom axioms) should be stated for each
   code block.

4. THE DUAL HIERARCHY IS THE SECOND SURPRISE. After the
   three-axiom characterization (§3–6), the dual hierarchy
   (§9) is the second major finding. Give it full space.

5. THE CM RESCUE IS THE THIRD SURPRISE. Section 8 is the
   paper's strongest original result: a positive decidability
   theorem for a nontrivial subcategory of motives over ℚ.
   This is what transforms the paper from "classification"
   to "classification + theorem." Lead Section 8 with
   Theorem E stated cleanly, then unpack the three lifted
   obstructions, then present the algorithms. The failure
   of the general CM conjecture (dimension ≥ 4) should be
   stated first as motivation — the rescue is sharper
   because we know exactly where it breaks.

6. RESPECT THE READER. The audience knows more algebraic
   geometry than the author. Do not explain what a motive is,
   what a Tannakian category is, or what the Standard
   Conjectures say. Explain what constructive mathematics is
   (§2) because they may not know that. Then get to work.

7. THE HONEST ASSESSMENTS STAY. The roadmap probabilities
   (0% for Hodge, 0% for RH, 85% for BSD rank 0/1) are a
   feature, not a weakness. They demonstrate that the author
   understands the limitations of the framework.
