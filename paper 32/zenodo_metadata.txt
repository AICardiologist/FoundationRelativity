TITLE:
QED One-Loop Renormalization: The Landau Pole --- Constructive Reverse Mathematics of the Running Coupling, Threshold Crossings, and the Landau Divergence (Paper 32, Constructive Reverse Mathematics Series)

DESCRIPTION:
Paper 32 in the Constructive Reverse Mathematics of Mathematical Physics series. This paper provides a complete constructive reverse-mathematical calibration of quantum electrodynamics (QED) at one-loop order. The central surprise: the Landau pole divergence --- often presented as a fundamental crisis of QED --- is fully BISH-computable. The closed-form ODE solution for the running coupling constant provides an explicit Cauchy modulus requiring no omniscience principle. Six theorems classify the logical cost of each QED operation: discrete renormalization group steps and coupling below the pole are BISH, the Landau pole divergence itself is BISH, threshold crossing decisions cost WLPO, and global coupling determination costs LPO via bounded monotone convergence. Ward-Takahashi identity preservation is BISH. All results formalized in Lean 4 over Mathlib with zero sorry. The formalization comprises 8 Lean source files.
