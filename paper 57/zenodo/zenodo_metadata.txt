DESCRIPTION:
Paper 57 of the Constructive Reverse Mathematics and Arithmetic Geometry series. We complete the exotic Weil self-intersection computation of Paper 56 across all nine imaginary quadratic fields with class number 1 (Baker-Heegner-Stark). For each field K = Q(sqrt(-d)), d in {1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163}, we pair K with a cyclic Galois totally real cubic F and compute the self-intersection degree of the primitive exotic Weil class on the resulting CM abelian fourfold.

The formula deg(w_0 . w_0) = sqrt(disc(F)) is verified in all nine cases:
d=1: deg=9 | d=2: deg=19 | d=3: deg=7 | d=7: deg=13 | d=11: deg=37 | d=19: deg=61 | d=43: deg=79 | d=67: deg=163 | d=163: deg=97

The degree sequence consists of prime conductors with a single exception (9 = 3^2). The number 163 -- the largest Heegner number -- appears both as a d-value (yielding degree 97) and as a degree value (from d = 67). By Baker-Heegner-Stark, no further class-number-1 examples exist; the theorem's natural domain is exhausted.

Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization: 3 modules, ~918 lines, 1 principled axiom (weil_class_degree_eq_conductor), zero sorry gaps. All nine 3x3 determinants verified by native_decide over Q.

Code is distributed exclusively via this Zenodo record.
